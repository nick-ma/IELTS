Dear Sir,

I am writing you this letter to complain regarding a severe condition in my neighbourhood caused by teenagers.

I have been residing in this town for the last five years. It was extremely peaceful and quiet locality up till a few months back. But now the situation has changed after few families shifted here. They all have untrained bulldogs with them I don’t know for their safety or for any other purpose. Further, the cause of concern is that they let them go free in the evening with their teenagers running behind them as if there is any competition or race creating fear and terror among other peaceful residents. On the contrary, when we complained asking them to avoid this activity these families not only misbehaved but also threaten us of dire consequences.

In this worry some and tensed situation I would expect you to take serious notice and send these families a warning letter to eliminate all of this fuss otherwise they would be expelled from the neighbourhood. This would be a sigh of relief for all other families living there.

I sincerely hope that an immediate action would be taken all those involved in creating a havoc in this peaceful locality.

Yours faithfully.

Dear Sir,

I am writing to draw your attention to a situation that has been developing in my neighbourhood.

Recently, I have witnessed many dogs on the loose in the neighbourhood. The dogs, which are fierce looking and not muzzled, are given license to run around the neighbourhood. They are intimidating, especially to children and the elderly. I am afraid that it’s just a matter of time before someone gets seriously injured.

The owners of these dogs, a bunch of adolescents, seem to be unaware of the dangers of letting their pets off the leash and have adopted a nonchalant attitude. The teenagers have been asked by numerous locals to keep the dogs under control but all requests have been ignored and the situation has not improved. I therefore, believe that immediate action must be taken and I ask that you investigate the matter and take appropriate action as soon as possible to prevent the occurrence of injury and serious bodily harm.

Yours Sincerely,

Carol Diana

## Model Answer 3:

Dear Sir,

I am a resident of Block ‘A’ of XYZ society in flat number 100.  Sir, I am writing this letter to you due to a certain callous attitude of some young children who reside in the said society where you hold the position of the Secretary of the Residents Welfare Association.

By virtue of this letter, it is brought to your notice that certain adolescents who reside in our society create a dangerous situation, quite often, by letting their pets, especially the dogs, run wildly throughout the society.

Sir, as you are aware of the scarcity of space left for the pedestrians due to numerous vehicles in the society, it becomes too difficult to negotiate the bylanes due to a constant threat of a possible confrontation with a dog. Moreover, it is not possible for the elderly residents, who are present in most of the flats, to have an evening stroll in the park or to even walk inside the premises of the society.

In view of this, it is my humble request to issue a letter, through the medium of your office, to make the parents of such adolescents aware of the grim situation that is created by the irresponsible, uncaring and uncalled behaviour and attitude towards not only their fellow mates but also towards the society and the mankind, especially the senior citizens, as well.

Sincerely,

Neeraj
