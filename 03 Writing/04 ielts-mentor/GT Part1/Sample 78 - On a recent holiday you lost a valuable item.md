# On a recent holiday you lost a valuable item. Fortunately you have travel insurance to cover the cost of anything lost.

Write a letter to the manager of your insurance company. In your letter:


 
Describe the item you lost
Explain how you lost it
Tell the insurance company what you would like them to do
You should write at least 150 words.

## Sample Answer:

Dear Mr. Smith,

Recently I had availed your insurance service and had a wonderful time in the Perth trip. I am writing this letter to inform you that I have lost my professional cannon camera during the trip.

We stayed in Perth for three days and I had clicked so many amazing pictures. Luckily, before leaving for the airport I transferred all the pictures into my laptop. I clearly remember that we clicked our last picture at the entrance of the hostel and left for the airport. I wanted to capture last moments of our journey so I was looking for my camera and unfortunately I could not find it. I called to the hotel staff to look for it where we took our last photo but he confirmed that he could not find it.

As per the travel insurance, I am entitled to receive the coverage of the lost item. It was cannon UX-324 model camera which is hard to get due to its high demand. I would like to claim for the camera's original price as it was fairly new camera. I would appreciate if you could transfer the money into my account.

Looking forward to hearing from you.

Yours faithfully,
Naaz
