Dear Mr. Anirudh,

I am writing to inform you that I will not be able to join the office on decided date that is on 13th Jan 2015. Please allow me to elaborate on this.

I have to rush to my home town Reading for a week as some personal exigency has arrived. I just got the news and I am informing you first hand. My father has fallen and broke his ribs, he is hospitalised now. My mother is too old to handle all this alone. Hence I need to visit them immediately.

I would request you to empathize with my situation. I am very much keen and excited to join the office and would love to work under your supervision. Kindly postpone my date of joining by another week that is 18th Jan 2015.

Looking forward to hearing from you soon.

Thanking you,

Geetika

## Sample Answer 2:
Dear Sir,

I regret to inform you that it is not possible for me to join your company on the first week of April month as I had told you at the interview. I need extra one week to join the Smith Company because suddenly I had been attacked by severe viral fever.

In the interview, I told you that I require 15 days to finish my current office works. Unfortunately, I was in hospital for seven days due to the fact that a severe fever attacked me. Therefore, I could not complete my works, so I need extra seven days to finish my current job works. If you want to see the prescription from my doctor, I will show you at your convenience.

However, I am eagerly waiting for joining to your company. I can join in your company in the second week of April.  If I need to talk anyone for this matter please let me know, I will be ready to explain my situation to him. Sorry for any inconvenience that might arise for this.

I look forward to hearing from you soon.   
 
Yours faithfully,
Mahtab

Sample Answer 3:

Dear Mr. King,
I have been recruited by your organization in the last walk-in held at your LA office and am supposed to join you next week. However, due to some personal emergency I will not be able to do so and thus I am writing this letter to you.

Last week, my mother was very ill and I had to rush her to a local hospital. After a few tests, the doctors informed us that she had sugar problem viz. diabetes. She was prescribed with a dose of medicines to keep her sugar level in check. The doctor instructed that she should be brought for a daily checkup to the hospital for the next three weeks. Co-incidentally, my father is away in another city for work and I am the only one to take her for the checkup.

I sincerely apologize for not being able to turn up to work next week but I assure you that I will be available in office, on the Monday of the week after i.e.  14th May 2015. My father is returning home in the next weekend and he will then take over the responsibility of taking my mother to the hospital from me, making me available for my office commitments.

Yours Sincerely,
John Carter.
