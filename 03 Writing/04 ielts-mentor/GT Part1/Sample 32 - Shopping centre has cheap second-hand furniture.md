Dear Sir/Madam,

I have just arrived from overseas and need to have some furniture for my unfurnished flat. A friend has told me that you have some cheap second-hand furniture for sale.

Perhaps you can help me. I would like a kitchen table, some chairs, a double bed, as well as a single bed for a visitor, a cupboard for our clothes, and a bookcase. If you sell home appliances, I would like a microwave oven, a fridge, TV set and a CD player too. These must all be clean and the electrical items must be in good working condition with a guarantee of at least three months.

I would be grateful if you could give me some prices for these items. If you do not supply electrical goods, can you recommend another shop which does? Also, could you let me know what you would charge to deliver goods to the High Street?

Thank you for your help. I look forward to hearing from you.

Yours faithfully

Garcia Hall.

Dear ABC,

I’ve been informed by one of my friends about the availability of cheap second-hand furniture in your shop, which happens to be in the shopping centre situated at the UVW square near the famous WVU cinema hall in the suburbs of VUW (city), by the name ‘Opportunity Shop’.

In this context, I’d like to know the cost of certain items which I require for an unfurnished flat which is two blocks away from where your shop is situated.

I’d like to have a quotation for a pair of sofa set with two side tables, a dining table comprising of eight chairs, a centre table and items required in the bedroom, like the king size bed, a dressing table and one wooden almirah of not more than six feet height.

You may send me the best possible price which you can offer me for any item which is available to you either through a revert mail or through e-mail, the address of which is provided hereunder, with subjects as ‘Opportunity Cost Quotes’.

Apart from this, you must categorically mention as regards the transportation cost, if any. You may further do inform about any scheme which is in force right now in respect of discounts, if any, offered on purchase of an amount exceeding a certain limit.

I’ve also been informed by my friend, who referred me to ‘Opportunity Shop’ about the cash discounts which are offered at your shop.

In this respect, I’d further like to inform you that I’d be discharging my liability, in respect of the bill as raised by you, by paying the total amount in one go.

In anticipation of an early reply.

Regards,

MNO
