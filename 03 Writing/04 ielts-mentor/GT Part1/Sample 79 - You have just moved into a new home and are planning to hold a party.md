# You have just moved into a new home and are planning to hold a party. You are worried that noise may disturb your neighbor.

Write a letter to your neighbor. In your letter:


 
introduce yourself
describe your plans for the party
invite your neighbor to come
You should write at least 150 words.

## Sample Answer 1:

Dear Mr. Simpson,

I am your next door neighbor. As you may have already noticed, we have recently settled in this flat. Therefore, I have not the opportunity to be acquainted with you yet. In fact, we are a family of three: me, my wife and our 8 years old child.

The following Sunday is going to be my son’s birthday; hence, my spouse and I have decided to celebrate with family and friends on that special night in our apartment. The party will commence on 7:00 pm and terminate around midnight. It will consist of some music and dancing indoors in which a small music band will also be attending; however, dinner will be served about 10:00 o’clock in the garden. Although the participants are comparatively limited, we are afraid to bother you by late night noises.

On the other hand, I had initially intended to invite you and your family to our ceremony by phone, but I hesitated whether it could be a good idea or not. After consulting with my wife, she suggested it would be more appropriate if I write a letter to do so.

We will be deeply pleased in case you kindly accept my invitation to our beloved one’s celebration. In this way, not only find we the chance to become familiar with you, but the gathering might also perturb you less.

Best Regards,
Ali Kazemian

## Sample Answer 2:

Dear Ms. Meena,

I am Priya and I have recently moved to the house with my family which is opposite to yours. This letter is regarding the party which I have planned to throw on the 10th of June and to invide you to be present on that party.

Since this is the first time our family is moving to a house that we own, we have planned to throw a party for friends, colleges, relatives and neighbours. We have arranged a party to celebrate our happiness, and want to share this special moment with the people we care and love.  I have also planned to arrange a music band which would make the event more enjoyable. I hope you do not hate music!

I would feel very delighted if you could also appear to this and make it a very special party.

Sorry for any inconvenience it would likely to cause you, but I assure you that I have already made arrangements  to make it quite less noisier; by a plan to conduct games for children and keep them engaged and placing a sound  proof coverage at the  entrance of my house.

Hope you will accept my invitation and enjoy the party!

With Best Wishes,

Priya
