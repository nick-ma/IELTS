## Sample Answer 1:

Dear Sir/Madam,
 
I am writing you to apprise you of a small accident that involves a car that I hired from your company.

I am Preeti Ghuraiya and I hired a Maruti Swift Car (Number: MP07 5234) from your city centre Store, Bangalore, on 1st of Dec for 4 days.

I had hired this car for my family holiday in Mysore, but unfortunately, I met with a small accident while returning on 3rd Dec evening. As it was dark and in absence of proper street light, I could not notice a opened pot hole on the road on time; and applied break suddenly, due to which, the car behind, collided with my car. Although, there was no major damage but the light on the left hand side was broken and had a small dent.

Though, I have got the light and dent fixed at the Maruti authorized service station, but the small scratches are still visible. Please accept my sincere apologies. I am willing to pay some extra charges as compensation, if required. You can send me the final bill at my residence address and I shall clear all dues in next 3 days.

Please feel free to call me, in case further information is required.

Truly,
Preeti

## Model Answer 2:

Dear Sir,

My name is Ankit. I hired a Toyota Altis car on Monday, 17th of August 2015 from your head office located at Serangoon, for a period of 15 days. The registration number of the car is SGT 2345D. I am writing the letter to inform you that I have met with a minor accident today.

I was on my way from my home to office and at the Raffle place city junction, a car in the opposite direction just tried to cross the signal when it was red. Due to his rash driving, his vehicle slightly touched the right side of my car. I tried my best to avoid it, but could not help much. The driver side's rear view mirror detached and also led to some scratches on the right side of my car. The car looks a bit ugly.

Immediately, I called police and within 5 minutes they arrived. I assisted them in writing the report. I will send the repot to you soon so that you can claim the insurance for the repair costs. But I replaced the rear view mirror from the nearby garage as it is very necessary for driving.

If you need any further information, I am available at 98765678.

Yours sincerely
Ankit
