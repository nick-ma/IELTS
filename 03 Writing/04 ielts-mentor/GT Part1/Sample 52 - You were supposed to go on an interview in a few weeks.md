## Sample Answer 1:

Dear Sir/ Madam,

I am writing to apologise as I will not be able to present myself for the interview which is scheduled in the next week.

I have found myself in this unavoidable situation for a reason. My immediate boss is out of town for the rest of this week and the following next week as well. Thus I have been made responsible for handling our overseas clients who are due to visit us this week. They are scheduled to leave not earlier than the next weekend. Therefore I will be unable to attend the interview.

I would request you to please postpone the interview date to a later date preferably after two weeks, if feasible. This would allow me enough time to complete my tasks and be available for the interview. I aspire to be working with professionals like you in your esteemed organisation. I look forward to getting a favourable reply from you soon.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Yours faithfully,
Jeremy.
