# You would like to buy some electrical goods at a shop in a nearby town.

Write a letter to the shop and ask if they have the things you want or whether they will be able to order them. Ask what the prices are and how long they will be able to hold the goods for you.


 
You should write at least 150 words.

## Sample Answer 1:

Dear Sir/Madam,

I am writing this letter to enquire about the goods I want to purchase from your shop. I am looking for a crystal flower vase with electric light in it, which I saw when I visited your shop last time.  

As the vase was the last piece available and I saw one of your customers was purchasing that, I am writing to confirm that I am very eager to purchase it. I had placed my order in my last visit only with no advance money. I want the vase in blue colour in light.

It would be fine if you have some other design but it should made up of crystal and twilight blue colour light.

Please, let me know if the product is available in your shop, or if you would be able to arrange it from somewhere. I am coming Canberra in the beginning of the next month, and can down to your place if you are able to get the product and retain for some time.

Looking forward to hearing from you.

Sincerely yours
Namrata

## Sample Answer 2:
Dear Sir,

This is in reference to an enquiry regarding the availability of 7W LED lights and fixtures with multicolor feature in your store. Your store is situated near to my locality, but as I am out stationed presently, I would like to know the availability of the above referred lights in your electrical store. If the lights are available kindly reply me with the unit price, available quantity and discounts applicable. Also further in case of non-availability kindly let me know the prospects of ordering the same for me and making it available.

As I am stationed outside, I need the lights the moment I reach my home town, as I am renovating the house I need around 120 noâ€™s of lights to be fixed. As you own the nearest electrical store in my home town, I take this opportunity to seek quotation from you regarding the availability and cost of the bulbs and fixtures. Further please do reply about the allowable time to withhold the ordered items for me, as I would be seeking delivery of the same when hence I reach the home town, I request you to let me know the details as  appraised.

In addition to the above kindly specify the advance amount to be paid in case of ordering.

Waiting for a prompt reply form your end.

Thanking you.
