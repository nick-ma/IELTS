## Model Answer 1:

To the Editor,

I am writing to review my recent visit to Yummy Restaurant. I made a reservation for my sister's birthday bash which occurred last week. Originally I thought only ten people would attend, but apparently, the number increased to fifteen people on the day. At first, I was worried that it would not be possible for the restaurant to accommodate more people. However, I was pleasantly surprised when the Manager told me that they could do it and would even upgrade our room to a more spacious one. The overall service was impeccable and the party went smoothly, thanks to the great staff.

We ordered a three-course set menu and the taste was top notch. The escargot entree was absolutely divine that I could still remember the taste of its garlic butter sauce till now. My sister ordered pan-fried salmon fillet with mashed potatoes as the main course, and people were raving about it. The dessert was a mini-opera which I thought to be rather average, though it might simply because I do not have sweet teeth.

Overall, we experienced a wonderful night at this restaurant. This place is highly recommended and we have even started planning our next visit.

Yours faithfully,
Helen

To the Editor,

I am a long standing member of our local community and I am writing a recommendation to other citizens for one of our fine neighbourhood dining establishments; The Lone Star Café.

There were many impressive attributes which struck me upon my entrance, such as the décor and audience. I particularly enjoyed the laid back attitude of the place. But for my mind, it was the service along with the size and quality of the portions that was most memorable.

The service was professional yet intimate, and along with the sheer quantity of the dishes served, motivated me to pass on my recommendation. I enjoyed a steak of mammoth proportions and a giant fresh, crisp salad accompanied by a selection of appropriately selected seasonal vegetables. The piece de resistance, however, was the rich Black Forest gateau served as dessert –and all for a reasonable price.

I hope after reading this, potential customers will frequent this diner – Bon appetite.

Yours truly

To the editor,

I am an inhabitant of Panadura city in Kaluthara district. This is to inform you regarding a fantastic hotel I visited with my family last week.

I have visited there with my family to have the dinner. The restaurant’s name is River view, as its name suggest there is a wonderful river view. The restaurant was decorated gorgeously around 9.00 p.m. while we were there. We ordered fried rice, chicken curry, Parata & lunumiris since my family likes that menu and there are lots of menus I personally felt to eat at that moment. Waiters have served foods very quickly & the food was delicious as I still remind the taste of chicken curry. Normally, I don't each much at night, but in that day I had a big and a nice meal. Fried rice was also very tasty and it is very hot as it gives the great taste to the mouth.

After having this we have ordered watalappan for desert. That's one of Indian desert Sri Lankan people mostly prepare. Desert was also very nice to us. This letter is to inform about this restaurant to the mass people because it is a worth visiting place.

When considering the food, the place, the bill and everything, the River view restaurant is the best place in my town.  My family members also appreciated that dinner meal since it is scrumptious and they gave special thanks to me for getting them to there.

Hope these details would be helpful to people to find a good hotel.

Thank you

## Model Answer 4:

To the Editor,

I am writing to draw your attention to a local restaurant that is providing wonderful services to its customers and I request you to publish a review of this restaurant in the ‘Food and Life’ section of your famous daily to let people know about it.

Recently, I took my family to dine out at a local restaurant named Golden Spoon located at Lalmatia, Mohammadpur. The restaurant mainly serves Chinese and Thai food, although they have arrangements for continental dishes. It is a separate two-storied building roofed over with corrugated iron on the main road. There is ample space for car parking in front of the restaurant. The restaurant is decorated with paintings and soft lightings, and wonderful wooden furniture. We were overwhelmed by the soft music being played at low volume. There was a playing corner for children on the first floor. We were also delighted at their warm reception.

Initially, I ordered for Thai soup, chicken fry, rice with beef and prone, and Salad. The food was so fresh and delicious that we could not but order for more fried chicken. Prices were also relatively lower than that of other restaurants in that area. The waiters gave us a great service.

In conclusion, I can ensure that the restaurant is visit-worthy for the food lovers who like to taste different dishes and want the best return of their money.

Thanking you,
(Enamul Kabir)
