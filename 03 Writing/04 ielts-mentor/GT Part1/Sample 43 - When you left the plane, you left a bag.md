# Last week you were on a flight to London. Unfortunately, when you left the plane, you left a bag. You did not remember about the bag until you got to your hotel.

Write a letter to the airline. Explain what has happened, describe the bag and its contents and say what you would like them to do about it.

 You should write at least 150 words.

 You do NOT need to write your own address.

Dear Sir/Madam,

I am writing this letter with regard to my lost bag on the plane. Last week I flew from New York to London. When I reached the hotel room, I realised that I had left my bag on the plane.

When I entered on the plane I kept it under my seat as all the overhead bins were filled with bags. When I got left in London I forget to take my bag. I left it under my seat. It is a black leather bag, of medium size. It has two pockets in the front and one small pocket in the back. It is a really soft and beautiful bag. Also, it has a silver colour zip and key chain on it.

My bag contains certain important documents, a small brown purse which consisted of my ID cards, licence, money etc. and some clothes. Those documents are really important and I need to submit them to my office next week. So if you could help me in finding the bag, I would be really grateful. When you get that bag please inform me through this email id-soniavincent@gmail.com. I will come and collect it from the Airport promptly. Could you please make an arrangement for finding it. Thank you for your kind attention.

Yours faithfully

Sonia.

## Model Answer 2:

Respected Sir/ Madam,

I am, Sharon Mond,  writing this letter regarding a bag that I left on one of your planes last week. On Monday 24th July I came to London on flight FRC - 2547-A  from Sydney. According to my ticket, my seat number was D-5A. The plane arrived 2 hours late at mid-night and I was worried and tired. I spelt for half an hour and as a result, when I returned home, I suddenly realised that I had left my bag on the plane under the seat in front of me! I felt pretty stupid about the mistake I made.

My bag is small in size and is made of brown leather with a zip opening the top. Inside the bag, there is a credit card, debit card, a book that I was reading titled 'War and Peace' by Leo Tolstoy, some car keys, my mobile phone and some important business documents.

I, therefore, request you to have your lost property department  check and see if they have my bag and contact me as soon as possible to let me know whether they have found my bag or not?

You can contact me on my mobile telephone number which is: +0299465467484 or email me at sharonmond@hotmail.com.

Thanking you in advance for your kind help, I look forward to hearing from you soon.

Yours sincerely,

Sharon Mond
