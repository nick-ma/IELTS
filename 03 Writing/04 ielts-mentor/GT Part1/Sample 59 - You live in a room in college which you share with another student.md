# You live in a room in college which you share with another student. However, there are many problems with this arrangement and you find it very difficult to work.

Write a letter to the accommodation officer at the college. In the letter:

- describe the situation
- explain your problems and why it is difficult to work
- say what kind of accommodation you would prefer

You should write at least 150 words.

## Sample Answer:

Dear Sir /Madam,

My name is Namrata, and I live in the room No –L202, which is two-bed-shared room in your college hostel. I am writing this letter to let you know my concerns about the room, where I am facing some unavoidable and unmanageable problems and those are impacting my study badly.

First of all the room is very small to accommodate two beds in that let leave the other necessary furniture. We hardly get space to walk or move in this room and because of that we got hurt many times by the sharp corner of the iron beds. There is no proper ventilation facility in this room and we scarcely get the sun light and fresh air. We are bound to use the light 24 hours a day and this is not good for our physical and mental health. It’s quite suffocating and because of this I am not able to concentrate in my study. I go to one of my friends’ room whenever I have to study. Moreover the attached bathroom lock has been broken and this is really embarrassing. We have complaint about this issue to carpenter twice, but could not get any response till date. My final exams are going to start from the early next month.

Therefore, I humbly request you to allot me any other room where at least proper ventilation facility is present. This would be very helpful for me to concentrate on my study and pass my exams with a good score.

Looking forward for your positive response.

Sincerely Yours,
Namrata
