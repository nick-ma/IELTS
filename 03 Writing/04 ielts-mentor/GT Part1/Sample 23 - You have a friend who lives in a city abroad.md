Dear Rachel,

Sorry, I haven't written for ages. I have been so busy over the last year and I never seem to have a minute to myself.

I'd like to study electrical engineering at university in Australia next year and I hope you can give me some advice. I think I would prefer Melbourne because I know a few people from my visit last year.This year I'm doing maths and physics at school and I hope to do well in my exams. However, I really don't know which university to apply to, so could you send me some information about different colleges? Also, can you find out what qualifications I need? For instance, as an overseas student, do I have to take an English test?

I hope you don't mind doing this for me. It is much better to get this information from someone who lives in the country, so I hope to hear from you soon. Many thanks.

Your Faithfully

George Baker

Dear Mary,

Hi! There, it has been so long since I have heard from you. How is the weather there in Australia? I am writing this letter to ask you some information about the courses offered at different colleges in Brisbane.

After the completion of my post-graduation in chemistry, I have been working as a chemist in one of the best laboratories in India. My regular duties are to analyse the quality of food products as well as to check whether they pass NABL prescribed standards or not. As my employer is pleased with my work he has handed over me a new responsibility of molecular modelling. I do not have any perfection in that field. So, I would like to join a molecular designing course over there in your city.

I would be thankful to you if you search and inform me the details of the appropriate institution with relevant contact numbers.

I look forward to hearing from you soon.

Yours,
Vishwa.

Dear Ali,

I hope this letter finds you in good spirits. I am writing to enquire some details about the internal audit related courses at a leading college in London.

As you know, I hail from a family where everyone is involved in the financial sector. Needless to say, I got my tertiary education from a business school, and at present I am working as an Internal Auditor in a textile corporation, but I have been stuck with the same designation for 2 years. Therefore, in order to climb further up the corporate ladder,

I would like to update my skills and knowledge, and the most plausible way to do that would be getting a foreign degree from London, UK. Having spent a copious amount of hours on researching the right institutions, I have narrowed down my options to just three colleges.

My intention in writing this letter is to ask for your assistance in getting in touch with those colleges. Perhaps you could dispatch me their customised brochures or prospectuses since due to the highly complex nature of these programs, information in the public domain is hard to find about these courses.

I look forward to receiving your response.

Warmest Regards,

Sam
