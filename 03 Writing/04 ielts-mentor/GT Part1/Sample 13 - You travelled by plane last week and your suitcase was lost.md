## Model Answer 1: 

Dear Sir/ Madam,

I was one of the passengers who took the flight from Kuala Lumpur (Malaysia) to Melbourne (Australia) on 16 March. Unfortunately, my suitcase did not come out after the flight. Although I have explained this to Mr Johnson who was in charge at the luggage Claim office and promised to give me a call within next 24 hours, but this did not happen.

My suitcase is a dark brown leather with a black handle. Inside the suitcase, you will find some clothes, souvenirs for friends I will visit. There are few books and two copies of a business proposal which I need for the presentation on 30 March.

I would appreciate it if you could contact me as soon as possible. If you could send this suitcase to me by courier service, I would be more grateful. I have arranged to pay for the service. My flight number, luggage claim number and address are written below.

Flight Number: MH 168
Luggage Claim Number: 00269
Address: 20 Golden Road, Seremban, Malaysia.

Yours Faithfully,
R

Dear Sir/Madam,

I was one of the passengers who took the flight from Narita (Tokyo) to Heathrow (London) on 5 August. Unfortunately, my suitcase did not come out after the flight. Although I have explained this Mr McDonald who was in charge at the Luggage Claim Office I have not heard from him as of now.

My suitcase is Grey Samsonite whose size is 10 x 95 cm. There are 3 stickers on one side and 1 heart shaped sticker on the other side. My initials "AR" are also written on both sides.

There are a few books and a copy of my thesis in that suitcase, which I need for the conference on 19 August.

So I would deeply appreciate it if you could give me a prompt reply at your most convenient. My flight number, luggage claim number and address are written below.

Flight No : NH 101
Luggage Claim No : 00026
Address : 6H Silver Street

Dear Sir/Madam,

I am a frequent flyer of Continental Airlines. I am writing you to inquire about a bag I lost during my last trip to New York on 15-January on flight number AB220.

While off-boarding the flight in New York I forgot to collect the bag from an overhead bin. I realised about the lost bag after coming out of the airport. So, I raised a request with your staff to recover the bag. After all the formalities, your staff said someone would contact me in 24 hours. But now it is already 5 days since the incident occurred and yet there is no update.

I need your urgent attention on this matter. For your information it a grey colour leather suitcase. There is a logo on the front side of the bag resembling a swan. The bag also has my name tag on it. It is a light bag containing few papers.

I request you to provide me with actions you are going to take on this matter.

I hope to hearing from you soon.
 
Yours sincerely,
Ramanuj

## Model Answer 4: 

Dear Sir,

I am writing this letter to know about my stolen suitcase. My name is Ali, and I was the passenger of the Soudia Airline Company. Last week, after my holiday was finished in Singapore, I travelled by plane, which was the Soudia Airline, in order to return my home country in London city. Unfortunately, when I reached the London Airport, my suitcase was lost.

The suitcase was made by leather, and it was black in color. Moreover, there was a scratch, which was in the left side, in the suitcase. Some important documents, a fountain pen, a diary, and some clothes were in the suitcase. Especially the documents are essential for me because it is significant in terms of my business purpose.

Although this event happened seven days ago, I have not got any response from your company. I am really dissatisfied with your service, and any update about the stolen suitcase is needed to me. Furthermore, I want to know what steps you have taken after the suitcase was lost.

I look forward to hearing from you soon.

Yours faithfully,

Ali
