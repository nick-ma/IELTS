## Model Answer:

Dear Sir/Madam,

I have learned from your newspaper advertisement that your centre is organising an international summer camp for overseas teenagers, and you are looking for a bilingual assistant tutor to work with the children. I am writing to you to recommend one of my best friends, Helen Wang, for this post.

Helen used to be my classmate at Beijing Normal University, where she was already a very active organiser and participant in extracurricular activities. With her outstanding leadership skills and cheerful personality, she was elected chairperson of the Student Union several times.

Busy as she was, she passed the College English Test Band Six and completed her major – teenage psychology – with an excellent school record. Upon her graduation, she was assigned to be a teacher in an international high school in Beijing, where she has been teaching bilingual lessons for five years. What’s more, she loves her job and enjoys working with children. This has won her great popularity among her students.

Therefore, I do not hesitate to recommend her as an ideal candidate for the post you advertised. I am sure you will make a wise decision in hiring her.

Sincerely yours,

Elizabeth Harley.
