## Model Answer 1:

Dear Sir/ Madam,

My name is Milad Rahimi and I have registered in one of your rooms for two weeks during my homestay’ program in New Zealand. I am very pleased that I can spend my vacation with your family and I’m writing to ask you for some advice.

I always was fascinated by your country and I am really happy that I can be with your family which would help me to learn a lot of things about your culture and way of life. As it is the first time I am coming to New Zealand, I am not familiar with the weather and I don’t know what kind of clothes I should bring. Would you please let me know how the quality of weather in New Zealand in the middle of September is? Also, I am a vegetarian person and I’m afraid that you would prepare appreciated foods for someone like me.

As you know, I will arrive there on 20 September and according to my ticket arrival details, I would be there at 4 pm in the airport, absolutely if I won’t have any delay in my flight.

I look forward to hearing from you in the near future.

Yours Sincerely

Milad Rahimi

## Model Answer 2:

Dear Mr Alex,

I have just received details of my future homestay at your family and writing to introduce myself and ask for some further information.

My name is Anna Frank, I am 21 and live with my family in Lyon, France, which is my hometown. My native language is French and I am looking forward to improving my English during the trip to New Zealand.

I would be grateful if you could provide more information about your family and its lifestyle. To begin with, I would like to ask you about your usual diet. It is very important to me since I am a vegetarian. Secondly, I would like to learn more about your family’s day routines, like games you used to play together, in order to get familiar with these activities while I am here. This could help me to participate in all your routines like a relative.

I am very eager to meet you in person! By the way, I have already bought the plane ticket and would be happy if you could meet me at the airport because this will be my first time abroad. I will arrive on September 13, at 10 am, Wellington time.

I am looking forward to hearing from you soon.

Sincerely yours,

Arc John
