## Sample Answer 1:

Dear Sir,

My name is Jones Nathan and I am glad to be informed that you will be my home stay host family during my visit to New Zealand. I received the notification mail from the college faculty mentioning the same few minutes back.

I am French by nationality, currently pursuing my graduation in London University, Britain. I am the only child to my parents who are settled in France. I have enrolled in the "English and home stay program" conducted at our off campus center at New Zealand.

I would be glad to know more details from your side, apart from the home stay facilities and amenities provided. My main concern would be about the transportation system and its availability during my outdoor engagements, which is expected to be from 10.00 to 16.00 hours of the day. Another thing is about information about neighborhood libraries, if any? In addition to this, I am curious to know about any French national whom you are in acquaintance with?

My expected arrival date is on 19th of this month and the flight is scheduled at 6.00 hours at Munich airport. It would be of great help, if you could fetch me from there as I am totally new to the place and language.

I am really looking forward to spend some quality time with you and family. It would be much appreciated, if you could revert to my queries at the earliest.

In anticipation for a prompt reply.

Sincerely yours
Jones.

## Sample Answer 2:

Dear Mr. Nithan,

Hope you are doing well!

I am, (...your full nameâ€¦), 22 year old student from India. I had applied for an English program in the University of Wellington and I have received a letter from university, apprising me that you will be my host family.

I am from Delhi, India and have completed my engineering. I have taken up this course as it will help me in future to get good jobs.

I was wondering if you could give me some information about the weather in Wellington, as I have not been there before; should I bring lots of winter wears? Could you also let me know the distance from your home to university and what will be the best way for commutation? I am also interested in learning musical instruments; are there any good music institute nearby?

I will be arriving in Wellington on morning of 10th of Dec. Though my course starts on 12th Dec; I wanted to reach a day or two prior to course commencement, as I wanted to get familiarise with the city and surroundings. Can you also let me know, the best way to reach your home from airport?

Looking forward to meeting you soon.

Best Wishes,
Preeti
