## Model Answer 1:

Dear Sir,

I’m writing to complain about the service that I received on 20 September from your shop. I’m really unsatisfied with your service and I hope that you take a prompt action on this matter. I always bring my computer to your shop for fixing and I’m one of your loyal customers.

Last month I found that my computer stopped working and after a few minutes it restarted. In fact, I didn’t pay attention to this issue until the problem kept reappearing over and over again. So, I took my computer to your store and your customer care officer promised me to fix the issue as soon as possible. After one week, I took it back home, but to my surprise, the problem came to existence while I paid $100 to your shop and waited for one week to appear my computer without any technical problems.

This is a frustrating and daunting experience that I have had with your service and I would ask you to refund me as you have done nothing for my computer.

I look forward to hearing from you very soon.

Yours sincerely
Milad Rahimi

## Model Answer 2:

Dear Sir/ Madam,

I am writing to express my dissatisfaction with the service I received at your establishment.

Actually, the computer I have bought at your store on the late January was quite good, however, after just half a year things got wrong. Some programs were getting frozen frequently. When I took my computer to your specialist and tried to explain the problem to the technician Michaels, he refused to take my computer into service because the problem did not appear that time. I was trying to convince him to spend more time to identify the reason it is getting stuck, but he was rude and impatient explaining this is the end of his shift. On the next day, another technician listened to me carefully and fixed my computer in 10 minutes.

I suppose your employee Michaels is not suitable for his position because of his unprofessionalism. I suggest you employing someone more skilled and with better personality in order not to waste your customers valuable time.

Faithfully yours,

Stuart Albert

Dear Mr Popkins,

I am writing to express my dissatisfaction with the service I recently experienced in your store. Since my computer had been having some technical issues, I have it repaired in your store two weeks ago.

One of your staff, whose name I cannot recall, promised me that its repair would be finished in three days. He also stated that while there were problems with my computer, they were not severe. Thus, none of my data would be affected. Three days afterwards, I was told that the repair will take longer than expected, so I had to wait a bit longer.

After a week, I finally brought my computer home. To my dismay, some of my important data was gone. Given what I was told previously, I was extremely disappointed and upset. Honestly, I did not expect such terrible service from your place. I demand that you give me a proper explanation as to how this incident occurred. You must also restore my missing data.

I look forward to hearing from you.

Yours sincerely,
Helen.

Dear Mr. X,

Latterly, I have used your computer fixing services. My computers had few critical problems such as sudden restart, blue screen, and slow startup. Your staffs fixed these problems. I got my computer this week on Monday from your store. Unfortunately, those problems have come back! and my computer restarts suddenly. I have a lot of works and projects doing via this computer. These works will be delayed if this not been fixed. This leads to putting me in a difficult situation in my professional career.

I need my computer will to be fixed on early Sunday. Of course, it should be done cost-free as I have already paid for the service. So, please make arrangements to fix it by your personnel as soon as possible. It's your kind to do it as fast as possible.

I am looking forward to hearing from you.

Sincerely,
Ali

## Model Answer 5:

Dear Sir/ Madam,
I am a regular customer of your service store and have found all of my interactions with your office very satisfactory. But, I am sorry to say that the service I received yesterday was not as per your excellence.
 
First of all, the service manager was not available at the time of the appointment of our meeting. I had to spend 45 minutes on precious Sunday morning waiting for your staff. However, this is the smaller issue. The Service Manager did not seem to have enough understanding of computer hardware and it took 30 minutes for him to understand the problem. Today when I collected my computer, I noticed that monitor still flickers and the invoice includes the cost of keyboard replacement. There was never a request to change the keyboard.
 
I request you to look into this matter and fix all the issue I had described to your staff. Additionally, I would also request you to remove keyboard replacement charges from the invoice.
 
Looking forward to hearing from you soon.

Thanks,

Your Regular Customer:

Ramanuj.

## Model Answer 6:

Dear Sir,
I am writing you to express my dissatisfaction with the repair work that you did on my computer’s heat-sink recently.

Last week, I brought my computer to you because it was overheating whenever I ran it for more than 2 hours. After careful inspection, you diagnosed the problem to be a broken heatsink that could not keep the processor cool. I was told that the problem will be fixed and that my computer will no longer heat up after you would have repaired the heat-sink. However, when I brought the computer home, the problem still persisted, and my computer was heating up even more than before. You can understand my shock when I realised that I had paid your store $200 for nothing.

My intention in writing this letter is to ask you to install a brand new heatsink in my computer at no extra charge. I can come by and bring my computer on Monday morning if it suits you.

I look forward to hearing from you.
Sam
