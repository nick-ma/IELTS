## Sample Answer 1:

Dear Sir,

I am writing this letter to your newspaper to protest about the development of our local airport where I live.

My home is situated in Bogra city near the Bogra International Airport even more than two hundred people, including children and older people, are living here.  There is a beautiful park in front of my home, where most people pass their leisure time playing, walking, and gossiping.

A huge noise is created especially at night when the airplane comes or departure in the airport. If the number of flights is increased, the noise will also raise in the local area. This could result in an immense embarrassment to the people in particular for the children because they need a quiet environment for their study purpose.

Moreover, the airport authority wants to expand the area; so, our lovely park, which is essential for every person of this locality, will be diminished. For these reasons, every person of our locality is against this proposed development. If you agree with me, please publish editorials to your newspaper to protest this unnecessary and detrimental development.

I am looking forward to hearing from you soon.

Yours faithfully,

Shohag

## Sample Answer 2:

Dear Sir,

My name is Jones and I am a business man. I am writing to express my protest about the new expansion plan on the Miami International Airport. My home is situated in the Callos street next to the airport. Optimum distance from the airport runway to my house would be less than 500 meters.

Since the inception of the airport, the residents of our street are constantly confronted with the problems of noise and turbulence, created by the flights arriving at the airport. This is a significant issue as major part of our population comprise of school children. The nuisance from neighbourhood does not allow the old people a peaceful night either. Moreover, the turbulence caused by the flight at times results in cracks or even broken glass doors and house cabinets.

Now given the situation, I believe that Miami is not among the front line airports of the country and that there is a restriction imposed by the government on the number of flights operated. I would like to plea to the president an arrest on this plan because an expansion of airport will aggravate the problems in the neighbourhood community. An increase in the number of flights arriving will cause more turbulence and nuisance, which is explicit. Though I am not against any development in our countries economy, it would be ideal if the government agency involved, in the new mission could come up with an alternate approach to this issue, so that the immediate neighbours to the airport are spared of more problems.

Last but not least, I would request your editorial section to publish a report on this moot issue on your daily.

In anticipation of a favourable action.

Yours sincerely
Jones Nathan.
