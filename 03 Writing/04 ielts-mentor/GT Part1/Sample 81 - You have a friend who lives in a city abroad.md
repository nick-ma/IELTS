## Sample Answer 1:

Dear Aparna,

Hope this letter finds you in a good health. I am writing this letter to share an exciting news that I am planning to join a course in your city.

I have been working as a software engineer in an MNC for the last four years, after finishing my engineering degree. So, I thought it is the right time to work on one of my dreams; i.e. to acquire a management degree. I am planning to leave the job and apply for a part-time management course in Sydney. Though I have inquired online for few of the colleges, could you confirm the details of accommodation facilities, course structure and fees by calling them?

I could not call due to the time difference between these two countries. I guess it would be easier for me to find a part-time job as I have profession experience. It would be helpful if you could share some popular job sites as well.

Looking forward to your reply.

Naaz.

 

## Sample Answer 2:

Dear Mimi,

Sorry I haven't contacted you for a month. I am really busy these days that I hardly have time to wind down. I hope things are going smoothly with your studies. By the way, guess what? I am thinking of applying to Oxford University too, which means we'll be living in the same city. How great is that?

As you know, ever since I finished my psychology degree four years ago, I have been working full time in human resources field. I'm currently working as an HR consultant, but I am especially interested in organisational development. That's why I decided to do a master's degree in ‘Organisational Psychology’. I've always wanted to pursue a postgraduate degree after all.

I am planning to submit my application to the university soon. However, I was recently assigned to work on a three-month project in Hongkong, so I don't know when I'll have the opportunity to contact the admission office. Do you mind contacting them to ask about their specific entry requirements? That would be a great help if you do.

Let me know what you think. Talk to you soon.

With love,
Helen
