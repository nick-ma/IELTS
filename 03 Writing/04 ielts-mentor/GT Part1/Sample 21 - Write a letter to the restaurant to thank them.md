## Model Answer 1:

Dear Manager,

I am writing to express my gratitude for the service I was offered on 30th December when I visited your restaurant along with my family and friends to celebrate my birthday. It was one of the most memorable Birthday events and your staff made it, even more, special by offering a complimentary Birthday Cake.

You have definitely won me as your permanent customer and I would love to recommend your restaurant to my acquaintances. The atmosphere inside the restaurant was very soothing and relaxing, Beautiful interiors and wonderful lighting system- accurately placed, neither too bright nor too low, make this place a perfect celebration and dining place. The taste of the food was just out of the world. Allow me to say that you made me nostalgic as the food tasted similar to what mother cooks for me back at home, though this made me miss my home and mother more!

However, I have a suggestion to make. You may think of introducing some discount cards or offer some corporate discounts to the people of the nearby area. This, I believe, would make our dine-outs more pocket-friendly.

I hope that you would consider this suggestion. Once again big thanks to you and your staff for making my birthday day more fantastic and special.

Your Sincerely,
Pooja Gupta

## Model Answer 2:

Dear Sir/Madam,

Last week on Saturday night some friends and I had dinner in your restaurant to celebrate my birthday. I am writing to thank you for the great evening that we had.

All my friends remarked afterwards on the standard of the food and service that we received. All the food was very tasty and well presented. Our waiter, whose name was James, was fast and friendly and put with well with our bad jokes! The restaurant itself was warm and friendly and the atmosphere showed that all the diners there were enjoying their evening.

I would like though to suggest one improvement. One of my friends is a vegetarian and he felt that the choice for vegetarians was little small. If you could develop that, it would be a great advantage to your restaurant.

Once again I would like to thank you for my highly enjoyable birthday dinner.

Yours faithfully,

Kelvin Smith

## Model Answer 3:

Dear Sir,

I am writing this letter to thank you for giving me and my friends a very fantastic and memorable evening at your restaurant.

As you know, last week I celebrated my birthday with my friends at your restaurant, which turned out to be a great success. Everyone enjoyed the arrangements at the poolside and the decoration of sparkling lights with a soft and soothing music in the background. Coming to the food, the presentation was as mouth-watering as the food itself. The service was fabulous too.

I am very satisfied with your hospitality. However, I have few suggestions to make it even better. Firstly, I had friends with children, if you could have added some interesting games for them that would have made the party more interesting.  Secondly, you should have a professional photographer of your own to cover such events. It would be very convenient for your customers.

I hope you find these suggestions helpful. I once again thank you for your admirable services.

Regards,
Mansoor Afzal.
