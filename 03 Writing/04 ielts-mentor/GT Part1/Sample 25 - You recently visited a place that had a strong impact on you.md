Dear Samuel,

How are you?, I hope you are fine as is with me, I am writing this in reference to our earlier telephonic conversation regarding a philanthropic activity.

I would like to draw your attention to an area where we can do a lot of social activity. Recently I along with a group visited a slum area. This slum is situated in an interior place away from the city outskirts and could be reached by foot only.

Upon entering the area, I was surprised by the children who were ready to welcome us; they were eagerly waiting that someone would bring something for them to eat. We spent about 4 hours by playing games, explained them the importance of personal hygiene, taught them few important social aspects, gave them food which we took along with us and at the end of the session we distributed around 30 winter blankets for each family in the slum.

When we were in the midst of the slum, I personally saw and felt their poverty, their longing for help and need of social awareness, when we were returning back we were so happy to see a smile on their faces and this happiness made me feel joyful and satisfied.

The trip to the slum infused me of an idea to gather few more and ask them for their help in helping the slum dwellers. I know that you are very much interested in these type of activities and as a person who is interested in philanthropic activities, I request you to lend your supporting hand in this program.

If you are interested let me know your consent so that you can partner with us in the next visit to the slum. I promise this would definitely interest you and fulfil your desire to do something social.

Thanking you and waiting for your reply in this regard.

Dear Leon,

I have just returned from my holidays in France and while we were there we climbed a mountain called 'Parleman' in the French Alps. We were able to drive half way up the mountain but then the road stopped. So we parked, put on our walking boots and began the long uphill struggle.

In spite of the road at the beginning, it still took us a while to complete the climb but it was well worth the effort. When we got to the top of the mountain, the view was incredible. I could see right across the town and the lake to one side, and on the other side were the snow-covered peaks of Mont Blanc. It was simply breathtaking.

As you know, we often go to France on our holidays and next time we plan a trip, I'd really like to take you there. I'm sure you would love the scenery and as you enjoy exercise, you would be able to take advantage of all the mountain walks.

I hope to hear from you soon.

Yours Truly
Paul MacCarney

Dear Rahul,

Last month I went to Mysore on a two day trip in one of the weekends for a holiday. The local tourist centre suggested me to visit the royal palace of Tipu Sultan, the Nizam of Karnataka in the 16th century.

On the day of my visit, coincidently it was also the festival of Dussera and the whole palace was lit up brightly as a part of the celebration. According to a local, the electricity used up on that day to light up the palace is almost equal to the electricity used up by the city throughout the year! The interior of the palace was as amazing as the shining exterior. There were specimens of weapons which were used during the wars in those times, pictures painted on the canvas of the royal family, details of the wars fought by the King and many more interesting things which are important from the point of view of Indian culture and history.

I wish to visit the palace again same time next year to be a part of the grand celebration and I would like to invite you to join me. I promise it would be a great experience.

Yours lovingly,
Raj

## Model Answer 4:

Dear Kakoli,

Hope you are doing great. I was away for a meditation course for a week and after my arrival, I got to see the beautiful birthday gift sent by you. Thank you so much. I had a nice vacation at the ‘Art of Living’ meditation centre and enjoyed my birthday amid perfect serenity.

Words are few to describe the place. Though located in a populated area like Bangalore, the meditation centre is very calm. What I liked most, is my fellow participants; they were full of positive energy. I feel, I have rediscovered myself in just those seven days. Believe it or not, I was in total silence for four days. In those four days, I could really reflect on my life goal and what I really want to do.

Why don’t you join me the next time? I know you are quite fond of meditation and yoga, so let’s plan a trip.

Take care and see you soon.

Your dear friend,
Ushree.
