## Model Answer 1:

To the Editor,

My name is Jack and I live in Seoul city. I am writing to recommend one of the best restaurants I have been to.

Last Friday was my birthday and I visited a Korean restaurant in my town. Personally, I did not expect anything about it because my originally booked Italian restaurant was cancelled due to some unavoidable reasons. Then I was feeling gloomy. However, the Korean restaurant's food swapped my melancholy state due to at that time, I ordered BBQ and ice-noodles and they served not only an incredibly delicious meal but also excellent customer services I have ever experienced.  

Moreover, the restaurant's manager told that most ingredients came from organic farms. The noodleâ€™s taste was really nice and also BBQ was perfectly grilled. Nevertheless, the restaurant was a wonderful choice for celebration but the location was not good. Any public transportation does not bring people to their location so I had to go there by my car. Furthermore, unfortunately, the manager told me that the restaurant owner was planning to close the store in the near future because of the lack of income.

It would be a good idea if you recommended the restaurant in your newspaper and I look forward to hearing your response soon.

Yours Sincerely,
Jack
