## Model Answer 1:


 
Dear Mithila,

Hi! My name is Jane Zhang, and I obtained your name and address from Pen Pals International. I am very glad to have this chance to write to you and become pen pals.

Let me first introduce myself. I’m currently working as a computer programmer in a large multi-national company. I graduated from Tsinghua University with a Bachelor’s degree in computer science in July 2004. While I enjoy my current job, I’m interested in pursuing a Master’s degree, and hope to begin graduate studies next September. My hobbies include listening to pop music (especially U2), playing the piano and erhu (a Chinese instrument), and playing tennis. I’m also very interested in travelling and have visited every province in China at least once.

This summer, I will be travelling with my mother to California. She will be attending a history conference at the University of California-Berkeley, and I have just received permission to go with her. We will stay in California for a total of 2 weeks – from August 2nd to 16th, 1999. If you are free, I would be very happy to meet you in person. Perhaps we could spend a day or two together.

Well, let me finish here. I am already eagerly awaiting your reply to this first letter. Please tell me all about yourself and your interests. I hope that we can become good friends.

Yours truly,

Daniel Red.
