## Sample Answer 1:

To
The manager.

Dear Sir,

I am very glad to join your company as a part-time employee. I joined here three months ago and I was honoured that you considered me as a deserving employee in your reputed company. I am writing this letter to raise your concern on my job contract.

I was appointed at your company as a part-time worker in the post of Financial Assistant. I was very much delighted to get the offer from you as this was a very excellent company to work with and I was offered a high salary. The promise for reaching upper was also another reason I joined here.

We have contracted for this job as a part-time employee for 9.00 pm to 6.00 pm. But the head of my department always forces me to come before 7 o'clock in the morning and this has become quite impossible for me. I have to drop off my son at his school at 7.30 am and there is no one in my family who can do that. I am not sure why the head of the department is forcing me to start office before 7.00 am while he never shows up before 9.00 am?

I am also shocked to face the unforeseeable trouble of working till 9.00 pm to finish my scheduled task. Sometimes I have to stay office till late hours while the whole office is deserted.

I really feel very nervous to tell the department head not to force me to come office before 7.00 am. That is why I am notifying you about this problem. I guess I should be given as much opportunity as it is offered to other employees. I can fully devote myself to work harder but something unusual and unreasonable should not be imposed on me. I want your intervene to have this problem solved.

I will be waiting to get a positive response from you.

Sincerely,

Sudip Pant

## Model Answer 2:  

Dear Sir,

I have been a part-time fitness instructor in your gym for four months. I was pleased to be offered the job, not only because I need to earn some extra money to cover my living expenses but also because I need some experience in fitness training.

It has been obvious to me that people often need help in using the gym equipment.However, it seems that the other trainers have not been encouraged to offer assistance to club members. I offer as much as I can, but this means that I am constantly in demand and therefore, working harder than anyone else in the gym. This situation seems rather unfair.

While I realise that members receive initial gym instruction, I feel that they also need ongoing help with the equipment. Could I suggest that a letter is sent to trainers promoting this? After all, personal attention of this kind makes people feel valued and may result in increased membership.

Yours faithfully,

Donald Green.
