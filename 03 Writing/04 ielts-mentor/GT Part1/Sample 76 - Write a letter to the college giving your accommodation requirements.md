Dear Sir,

I am writing to you to reserve my place in hall of residence for next academic year.

I am Preeti Ghuraiya, from India. I have been accepted in MBA course for next academic year by your prestigious university. Hence, I would like to enquire and reserve my place in university's hall of residence.

I am looking for a single room with attached bathroom or even a studio apartment would be fine. Apart from bed and cubboards, room should have a table and a chair, good ventilation and ample of natural light. Since I am a vegetarian, I would like to cook my own food, so accommodation with fully functional kitchen would be mandatory.

If the above arrangement is not available in hall of residence then I would not mind living with local families. However, I would prefer house with elderly couple without children as I don't want any disturbance with my studies.

Please let me know, if you would like to have any additional information. Waiting to hear from you soon regarding the availability and further process.

Truly,
Preeti

Dear Sir,

I am pleased to inform you that, I have been granted admission in your college and would be joining your college in the next academic year. In this juncture I would like to put forward my accommodation requirements during my period of study in your college.

Firstly I would like to know the feasibility of the college hostel its landmark area, its nearby areas and the transport facilities to reach the adjoining city. Apart from the above I would like to know what type of accommodation is available in your college hostel, its price and the facilities provided.

As I am of a middle class back ground Indian, I can accustom and can accommodate myself in a room on sharing basis. I would be pleased to have an individual room if possible or a conjoined room where I can share with other college mates, further I should like to inform you that if under conjoined accommodation I prefer to stay with my fellow country students if possible. Coming on to the food needs, I request you to let me know the available cuisines. As such being an Indian, I would prefer to have a dish prepared with rice and anything along with rice would make me satisfied.

The above stated requirements are in priority and flexible to me. If there couldnâ€™t be any match with my requirements, I am ready to opt to the available accommodation but will be pleased to know the available options in advance to accommodate myself in your college hostel.

Thanking you, waiting for your reply in this regard.

Yours faithfully.

## Sample Answer 3:

Dear Sir,

I am writing this letter to inform you that I recently got admission in your college and for that I want an accommodation in your college Hall of Residence.
Firstly, I would like to have a single room with attached bathroom. It should be near to any laundry service available in your college. If such accommodation is not possible then I could go for a shared bedroom but with only one female student.

Secondly, coming to the food I would prefer vegetarian foods as I am a vegetarian. If it is inconvenient for your college kitchen then I would appreciate if I could get an access to the kitchen to cook my own food.

The above stated requirements are my priority but if by any means they do not match with your facilities, I would prefer to know your available options in advance, so, I can make up my mind.

Please let me know, if you would like to have additional information. Thanking you in advance. I hope to hear from you soon.

Yours sincerely,
Afzal.
