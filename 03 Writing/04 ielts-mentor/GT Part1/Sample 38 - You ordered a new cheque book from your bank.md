# You ordered a new cheque book from your bank two weeks ago but you have received nothing.

Write a letter to the manager complaining about the bad service. Say when and how you ordered the cheque book. Ask how much longer you will have to wait and ask the manager what action he will take over this matter.


 

You should write at least 150 words.

You do NOT need to write your own address. Begin your letter as follows:

Dear Sir,

## Model Answer 1:  

Dear Sir,

I am writing to complain about the service that I have received at your bank. Two weeks ago I ordered a cheque book by filling out the appropriate form when I visited the bank but since then I have not received the cheque book and I have received no other correspondence from the bank. It is quite urgent for me as I have quite a few bills that I need to pay that can only be paid by cheque.

Please write to me as soon as possible and let me know how much longer I will have to wait for my cheque book and please explain why I have had to wait so long. I would also like to know what action you are going to take regarding this bad service.

I have been a customer of your bank now for fifteen years and this is the first time I have had to complain. It is very disappointing.

I look forward to hearing from you soon.

Yours sincerely,
Rocky

## Model Answer 2: 

Dear Sir,

I am maintaining a Savings Bank account in your branch under account number 001284511. I am a customer of this bank since last decade. The services offered by the bank are quite satisfactory, barring the last incident wherein I am still waiting for the cheque book for which I had put down my request two weeks ago!

It is to inform you that the request for the cheque book was forwarded through the portal of the bank. The corresponding request number, generated automatically, is 596-15. The request was generated on 15-May-2015, almost two weeks ago!

Sir, the cheque book is required on an urgent basis as I have to issue cheques to settle the government due, the last date of which is fast approaching. I would like to know the probable date by which the cheque book would be delivered at my residence so as to take appropriate action and explore an alternative method for the settlement of government due if required. It is so because, if the government due is not settled before the due date, a heavy amount of penalty will be charged upon me.

Further, I would like to get appraised about the reasonable action that would be initiated from your end so as to reduce the possibilities of re-occurrence of such bad incident/service which has been suffered by me

With regards
Mehra.
