Dear Sir / Madam

Re: Faulty jumper and refund refusal.

On Wednesday 2nd January, I bought a green long-sleeved jumper from your store. The jumper was medium-sized and made of cotton. It cost $59.95 and it was not on special.

When I got home, I discovered that there was a small hole in the left sleeve. It looks like a rip of some kind and the stitching has unravelled. I returned to your shop the next day to ask for an identical replacement jumper. Unfortunately, there were none in stock. Therefore I asked for a refund. However, the shop assistant refused to give me a refund because it was not in the policy of the store.

I am writing to demand a refund or, at the very least, a replacement jumper. The jumper is unwearable as it is and I do not want to buy anything else. I hope that you can assist me in this matter. If I do not get satisfaction, I will be forced to seek legal advice.

Yours sincerely

Amber Crew.
