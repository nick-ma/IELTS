## Model Answer 1:

Dear Sir,

This is in reference to the email transmission attaching the offer letter. Firstly I would like to thank you for the opportunity given to me to join and serve in your esteemed organisation, but due to the prevailing situations in my present organisation, I regret to inform you that I cannot join your organisation.

I, in my present organisation, was given a chance to handle a task independently under my leadership and I think that this is the right time to portray my capabilities to my present employer, it not only paves over for my organisational development but also for my personal development. In this juncture bidding adieu to my present employer is not a right decision, I once gain express my heartfelt gratitude for the belief you had on me and for giving me the offer, however, I would be in a position to join your organisation after the successful completion of my present assignment.

Please do consider my humble request and I am extremely sorry for declining the job offer.

Thanking you.

## Model Answer 2:

Dear Sir,

I am writing in response to the offer made by your company ABZ Ltd. for a job of System Analyst. Unfortunately, I am unable to accept the offer due to some reasons explained further in this letter.

Before citing my reasons for not accepting your offer, I would first like to thank you for giving me such an offer for the job. I am grateful to receive the offer from an esteemed company. The offer is good but due to my personal commitment to my current employer, I am not able to accept your offer. Kindly note that I joined my current job at ACD Company 2 months ago when I was in urgent need of money. At that time, my current employer Mr 'X' has trusted in me and offered me this job.

Thus, considering his faith in me during my tough time, it would be too early to change the job. I hope you will understand my concerns for continuing my present job and allow me to remain in your good books.

Looking forward to hearing from you soon.

Yours faithfully,
Ria
