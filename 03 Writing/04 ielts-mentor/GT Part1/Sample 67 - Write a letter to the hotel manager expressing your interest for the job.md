Dear Sir/ Madam,

I am writing to to apply for the position advertised by you in the daily Sunday times on 5th Dec 2014. I am Preeti Ghuraiya, 22years old student, studying general management at Garden City College,  Bangalore.

I am originally from Delhi and can fluently speak English and Hindi. This job opportunity looks very interesting and something in-line with my prior work experience.
I have 1 year of part time experience as receptionist and front desk operator with Hotel Holiday Inn in Delhi from June 2012 till July 2013. I was responsible for interacting with clients, handling client check in and checkout. I also have some experience as waitress. I feel this experience would help me in this job as well and I will be able to learn things fast.

The job description in paper does not give details of the duties to be performed. Would you be able to let me know, what duties will I be required to do and if you require any specific skills? I will be available immediately to start and can work in evening 7.00 PM to 10.00 PM every day and during the weekends.

Please let me know, if you need further information. I will be able to provide references of my experience.

Looking forward to your response.

Yours sincerely,
Preeti
