give details of the amount of time you need
suggest how your work could be covered while you are away.
Write at least 150 words.

## Sample Answer 1:

Dear Mr Maclarins,

I am writing to ask for a week off from my work. As you know that I am still preparing for my PhD in Surveying beside my work in the evening.

The main aim of taking one week off is to prepare and set for my final exams. Thus after considering this issue and after organising the tasks that I am in charge of, I would like to inform you that I rely on Jack for this responsibility. He will be covering my duties during my absence from April 15 to April 22.

I would appreciate if you could be helpful and understanding. Since I am satisfied with my job for your company, I look forward to accomplishing great improvements in my work for the future of our company.

Moreover, as I believe on Jack’s abilities to accomplish the work effectively, I hope that you don’t mind providing me with unpaid leave till I hand over my exams papers.

Thank you in advance for considering my situation.

Yours Sincerely,

Naji Lichaa
