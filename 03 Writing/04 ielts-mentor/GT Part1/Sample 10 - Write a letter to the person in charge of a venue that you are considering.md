## Model Answer 1:

Dear Sir/ Madam,

I am writing this letter to inquire about your party hall that we are planning to book for an official party. We are planning to organise an official get together party and I would like to know the available dates in the next month so that we can confirm the reservation and plan for our party. We are expecting some facilities in order to accommodate the party without any intervention and unexpected situation.

Our agenda will be staff meet-up followed by an hour long presentation, and it would conclude with a grand dinner party. We would need a high-resolution LCD projector, a big white board and Wi-Fi connection facility for Laptop. Seating arrangement is expected to be for almost 100 people. We also require facilities for welcome drinks for guests and dinner for 100 people.

I am curious to know about the rates to book the hall for 6 hours, from 4: 00 pm to 10:00 pm, with the list of facilities it offers. Additionally, it would be great if you can send us the full menu for dinner including drinks. I am also interested to know the best possible concession you can offer and breakdown of all expected expenses. In no way, we will compromise the hygienic and food quality and we are expecting the party to be organised without any glaring issue from your end.
I look forward to hearing from you as soon as possible.

Yours faithfully,

Mohammed

## Model Answer 4:

Dear Scot,
 
I am writing to inform you that we are considering your banquet hall for our annual company dinner that is supposed to be held at the end of October. Therefore, I would like to ask certain information regarding booking this venue.

First of all, the most important issue is the availability of the hall as per our schedule. Will it be available on the evening of 28th and 29th October? I would also like to know about the services such as menu, food quality and decoration etc. As it is our annual and most prestigious function of the company, so you should follow some decent theme for decoration. My recommendation is to use while flower along with white balloons.

Finally, please let me know the estimate of expenditure that will incur on this event. I am giving you my email for further communication, which is fahad.sultan@live.com. Previous experience with your company was exceptional but this time, I am expecting more innovative design and high quality of services.

Yours sincerely,
Fahad.
