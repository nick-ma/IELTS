## Sample Answer 1:

Dear Mr. & Mrs. Brock,

I hope you are doing great. It is a shame that we do not know each other very well and I would like to apologise for that. I am writing this letter to respond to your complaint letter that you sent me yesterday about the noise on last Saturday. I sincerely apologise for the inconvenience and humbly ask for your forgiveness.

With the concern of home safety, my wife and I decided to install a few smoke detectors in our flat, especially after we saw a devastating fire in our neighbourhood lately. We bought the devices from an online store and started to install and test the gadgets when the shipment had arrived. To ensure that the sound of the fire alarm is loud enough and everyone in the house would notice it, we tested the gadgets for about 20 minutes. Although the testing took place at midday on last Saturday, my wife and I are terribly sorry that your childâ€™s nap was bothered.

I beg for your understanding and forgiveness. Please accept this box of chocolate as a token of my deepest regret for the inconvenience.

Your Sincerely,
Lesner

## Model Answer 2:

Dear John,

Hope you are doing great. I'm extremely surprised to get a letter from you indicating that you're immensely annoyed to hear some sound, which is produced from my flat. Indeed, I've no idea that you'll be able to hear this enormous amount of sound.
 
However, as you know, some days ago, a glass of my window in the kitchen room was broken while some children were playing cricket in front of my flat. That is why I'm trying to refit the window in the evening time when I come back from office. It takes a long time because I have no experience on this work and it's still not finished.
 
Unfortunately, I thought that the sound will not reach to your home but it eventually did as per your claim. Since you have confronted many problems due to the noise, I apologise for this matter. Moreover, I promise this sound will no longer appear from today.
 
As the work is still not finished, I have decided that a professional worker will be called, who will work in the daytime and the work would be finished within two days.
 
Once again, I'm extremely sorry for any inconvenience that might have happened for me.
 
Best Regards,

## Model Answer 3:

Dear Mr. & Mrs. Jonathon,

I am writing in response to your letter, complaining about the sounds my musical instrument is producing. I feel that I have to explain myself and humbly ask for your forgiveness.

Actually, I am a student of the North Carolina Arts College and as a part of my end of term exams I have to perform 4 plays by a flute. Therefore I have to rehearse every day because I am eager to make a good impression to my teachers. To achieve my goal I am supposed to play about 3 hours a day.

I must apologise for playing in inappropriate hours. It was all my fault since I did not bother reading the rules of our house owner, prohibiting playing musical instruments.

I have consulted with my class teacher and he suggested me to use one of the rooms of the college to rehearse for a small fee. I assure you by no means will be disturbed again with the noise from my apartment.

I beg for your understanding and forgiveness. Please, accept this box of chocolate as a token of my appreciation for not giving this problem a legal action.

Yours sincerely,


Mark Aurther.
