## Sample Answer 1:

Dear Annie, 
 
How are you doing? It’s been a while since we have spoken to each other. I have a good news to share; I will be moving to London to take a new job that I have been offered. I will reach London on 15th of Jan.
 
As you know, I have never been to London before, so I was hoping if you could help me in finding accommodation. Though, my company has arranged a studio apartment for initial 1 week, but I will have to vacate the place after that.
 
My preference would be to live closer to my workplace, which is in central London, as it would save lot of travelling time and if I could get something near tube station and market place would be great. I am mostly looking for a studio apartment. If studios are not available, I would not mind sharing a flat with single girl. But the apartment should be spacious with good ventilation. My budget is around 500 pound per month. Do you think I will get something in that budget?
 
Looking forward to meeting you soon.
 
Regards, 
Preeti

## Sample Answer 2:

Dear Justin,

Hope this letter will find you in good health. I am writing this letter to let you that I got a new job in your city and I would be working with Optus from next month. My joining date is 1st June 2014. As you know I am new to that place so I will seek your help in finding accommodation.

My office is in Macquarie Park Sydney, I shall look for an apartment of single bed room. It would be fine if it has attached bathroom and a small kitchen area. My basic requirement is, it should not be much far from my work place, and 15 to 20 minutes’ walk is ok for me. I would like to live somewhere new, so something in modern apartment block would be great.

I am too worried about the place; therefore please help in searching accommodation.

Looking forward to hearing from you.

Sincerely yours,
Namrata
