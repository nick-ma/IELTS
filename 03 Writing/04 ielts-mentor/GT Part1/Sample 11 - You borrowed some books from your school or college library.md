## Model Answer 1:

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Rona Lyn Olivar. A 4th year nursing student and a regular borrower of the main college library with library number 442805. I am writing to you today because I am afraid I cannot return the books I have borrowed on time.

I borrowed 2 books namely Psychiatric Nursing 5th edition by Sheila Videbeck and Psychology for Nurses by Harold Mcgarry on the 15th of March and will be due today. However, it is very unfortunate that my grandmother has brought to the hospital in Makati Medical Center in Metro Manila, which is 5 hours away from this province. At the time you are reading this letter, I am now on the bus on my way to the hospital.

However, I asked my roommate to return the books I have borrowed today, but she said she can do it tomorrow because she has important things to do this day. I am willing to pay the fine as soon as I arrived.

I am hoping for your consideration regarding this matter.

Yours faithfully,
R. Olivar

## Model Answer 2:

Dear Sir / Madam,

I am writing this letter to explain why I had been unable to return three books I have taken on three-days loan, which is now overdue. After taking the books out on 16th March, I had an urgent phone call from my elderly aunt's neighbour to say that my aunt had had a fall and had been taken to the hospital. I am her only surviving relative in this country, so I felt I had to go and see her immediately. I travelled down to Surrey the following morning, thinking I would stay for only two or three days. Unfortunately, my aunt's condition has only improved very slowly, so I have had to stay here longer than expected. However, the hospital says that if all goes well, she should be able to go home in two or three days' time, in which case I will be back at the beginning of next week.

Dealing in mind the circumstances I trust you will kindly waive any fines that may have accumulated.

Yours sincerely

Mary Miere.

## Model Answer 3:

Dear Sir/Madam,
I am a regular member of your library. I am writing to you to inform about a possible delay in returning few books I had borrowed recently.

There are 3 books (names are provided below at the bottom of this letter) which I had borrowed last week and were supposed to be returned by 15-Aug. But, I regret to inform you that I would not be able to return them in time. Unfortunately, my Aunt fell ill last week and I had to travel to India on short notice. Looking at the current situation, I think, I would not be returning back before 20-Aug. therefore, I request you to extend the date of return by 15 days. I am willing to pay the fine if any involved.

I request you to write me back in case further extension is not possible with options available s per your library rules to solve this issue. Just to inform you, I would also be willing to pay the price of the book in case there is no solution in sight. Once I am back, I would be glad to donate these books to the library.

I am hoping to hear from you soon.

Yours sincerely,
Ramanuj

## Model Answer 4:

Dear Mrs Smith,

I got a book issued from the library for Statistics on 20 February 2015 for 7 days loan. It is due back on 27 February 2015. The book details are as below:

Name: Statistics for Managers.
Author: Dr Kuldeep Kumar.

Since one of my relatives has met with an accident in Melbourne, I had to come here to help his mother in dealing with hospital formalities and to take care of him.
Due to this emergency situation, I was unable to return the book before flying to Melbourne. I will be back to Gold Coast on the evening of 4th March 2015 and will return the book next morning on 5th March 2015.

I kindly request you to not penalise me as this is the first time that I could not return the book on time. I also request you to take into consideration my circumstance due to which I am unable to return the book before the due date.

Sincerely,

Mathew Jacob
(SID: 0000878)
