## Sample Answer 1:

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to express my dissatisfaction with a blender that I purchased from your store and the poor customer service I received afterwards.

Last week, I purchased a ‘White Line’ blender from your store at Madison Avenue after I saw the advertisement of this product in the newspaper. As soon as I tried to make a smoothie in the blender, its blades got clogged and have not been functioning properly since then even when I cleaned them up. In shock and awe, I called the customer service, but I was told by the sales person that there is nothing that she could do about it as she is not responsible for any problems that may arise after taking the product home. Since this purchase had cost me a small fortune, I have been inordinately stressed about the situation.

My intention in writing this letter is to request you to replace this broken blender of mine with a new one as I have a three-year warranty on this blender. Further, I expect you to issue a show cause notice to your sales person about her coarse demeanour towards me.

I anticipate prompt remedial action.

Yours sincerely,
Sam Adams

Dear Sir/Madam,

I am writing to express my dissatisfaction over a recent purchase from your shop.

I bought a blender from the Morphy Richards express range from your shop 5 days back. I came home and installed the blender the next morning by following the instructions provided in the manual. To my surprise, the blender did not switch on. I tried switching it on a couple of times before I finally phoned your shop.

Judy, who answered the phone, confirmed that the installation steps were correct and suggested that it may be a manufacturing defect. She assured me that the equipment would be replaced and that someone from the shop would arrive to collect the blender.

It has been 4 days since then and I am yet to be contacted by someone from your shop. I request you to look into the matter and suggest a solution. I am ready to drive down to the shop to hand over the blender, in case, a pickup cannot be arranged.

Looking forward to a speedy resolution.

Yours faithfully,
Mr. Walker

Dear Sir/Madam,

This is to express my dissatisfaction about the New Induction stove that I purchased from your shop, a couple of days back.

I found it working in good condition initially, but then after a few hours of its use, there appeared a problem .When I tried to increase the operating temperature, I could not do it and so it took a much longer time than needed for cooking. I am distressed that the sole purpose for its purchase failed.

In spite of calling to your shop’s toll-free number several times, nothing happened than waiting on the line for more than 20 minutes. Then later I was connected to the customer representative officer but he did not give any sensible answer to my query.

Finally, I decided to bring this to your focus. It would be great if you could replace my faulty induction stove with a new one or service the same and return it to my address since it has a valid warranty for two years from the date of my purchase. I think this matter deserves your serious attention and so address this problem as soon as possible.

Looking forward to hearing from you.

Regards,

## Sample Answer 4:

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing you this letter to register my complaint and express my utter disappointment regarding the food factory I purchased from your shop.

I visited your shop two weeks back and purchased a brand new sealed pack Philips food factory with two years warranty. However, to my sheer amazement when I opened the box and tried to run the food factory it was not working. I thoroughly checked all the connections as the problem could have been on my end but this was not the case. Immediately, I called the shop reception number and complained the person and providing him all the details as he requested too. He assured me that the concerned company representative will be visiting me in a couple of days and give you a replacement but this has never proved to be true.

I urge you to immediately send the owner company’s staff at my house already address provided to your receptionist and conduct an inquiry against this reception person because due to him I am suffering but also he is damaging your reputation.

I hope that an urgent action would be taken against my complaint.

Yours faithfully,
Mubashir Noorani

## Sample Answer 5:

Dear Sir/ Madam,

I am writing you today to complain about the microwave oven which I bought from your shop “kitchen corner” in last month and the model no of the product is Singer-MO3708G.

The main problem is that the power system of this oven suddenly stopped working, which I found after using 2 weeks. At first, I thought it was the connection problem of power supply board so I have it checked by a technician and he states that there was no problem in the power supply. After ensuring that, I called your shop and talked to Mr Rex, Asst manager, and he confirmed me that one of your technical support employees will visit my home within two days. To my utmost dismay, it has been 17 days since that conversation but still no one from your shop showed up.

Therefore, now I am looking for a prompt action from you as I have a valid 6-month guarantee card of this product. Please send your technical representative to my home as soon as possible.

I hope this issue deserves your sound attention.

Thank you in advance.

Sincerely yours.
Ms. Shadia
