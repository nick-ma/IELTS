## Model Answer 1:

Dear Sir/Madam,

I am writing to you regarding my joining date for the post of Internal Auditor that your organisation, KSM Chartered Accountants, offered me last week. I regret to inform you that I will not be able to join on the pre-agreed date. Please allow me to apologise for any inconvenience this may cause.

Please let me take a moment to elaborate why I will not be able to join your organisation on 15th June 2015. Unfortunately, last week while playing football, I sprained my ankle. For this accident, I was rushed to the emergency room and was hospitalised for the next few days. Since my doctor advised me to not to walk for the next few days, it will be practically impossible for me to join your company on the stipulated date.

I trust you can understand my dire circumstances. If possible, I would like to postpone my joining date by one week. Please let me know if this would be acceptable?

Looking forward to your supportive reply,

Sam

## Model Answer 2:

Dear Ms David,

I am writing concerning the position of Assistant Office Manager that I am due to begin next Monday. However, a problem has arisen.

As you know, I currently work for my uncleâ€™s food-packing business, and you will remember from my interview that I have gained valuable experience there.
Unfortunately, he has had to go into hospital for an operation, leaving my aunt in charge of both the home and the business. She has asked me, as this is a particularly
busy time of year, to stay on and help her with the running of the office.

I feel that it will be inconvenient for you but I very much hope that considering the circumstances, you would be prepared to allow me to take up my position with you two weeks later than you planned.

I would like to emphasise that I remain very keen to work with you and that I will be gaining further useful experience during this time.

I look forward to hearing from you.

Yours sincerely,
Brian Hall
