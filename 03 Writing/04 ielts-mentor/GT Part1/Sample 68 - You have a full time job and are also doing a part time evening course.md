## Sample Answer:

Dear Sir/Madam

My name is Namrata, a student of Microsoft office training batch T20 in your institute. I am writing this letter to let you know that I would not be able to attend classes from 20th June onwards. I am working with Optus and my timing is 9 AM to 5 PM.

To meet deadlines and to complete my work, I need to stay back and do extra hours. I reach home at 7 PM every day and feel so tired. I do not get time to practice the lesson taught in institute. Also I am going my native (Canberra) middle of the next month, and before my vacation starts I have to finish my office work.

Therefore I humbly request you to allow me to attend next available batch. This would be very helpful for me to manage office work and continue my training.

Looking forward to hearing from you.

Sincerely Yours
Namrata
