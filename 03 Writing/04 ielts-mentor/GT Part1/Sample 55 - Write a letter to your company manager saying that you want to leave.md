## Sample Answer:

Dear Mr Smith,

I am writing to you to apprise you of my decision to leave XYZ technologies.

During my tenure of 4 years, I have enjoyed my worked and have learned a great deal. When I joined the company, I was a fresher and did not know much about corporate life, but having spent 4 years with XYZ technologies, I am not only well versed with technical aspect of Campaign Management but also have gained significant process knowledge.

I was glad to be a part of campaigns management and planning team. I particularly enjoyed working under pressure during the campaign delivery and interacting with client. I have made some good friends and will miss them.

But as you know, all good things come to an end, and now I think it is time for me to take a step forward. I have decided to pursue MBA in marketing and have been selected in one of the UK's best university.

I would like to thank you for providing me your support and guidance during my tenure with the company

Sincerely,
P.
