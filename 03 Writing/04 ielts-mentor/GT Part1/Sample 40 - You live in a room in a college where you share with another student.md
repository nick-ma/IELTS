# You live in a room in a college where you share with another student. You find it very difficult to work there because your roommate always has friends visiting. He/She has parties in the room and sometimes borrows your things without asking you.

Write a letter to the Accommodation Officer at the college and ask for a new room next term. You would prefer a single room. Explain your reasons.
 
You should write at least 150 words.
 
## Model Answer 1:
Dear Sir / Madam,

I am writing to inform you that I wish to move into a new room next term. I would prefer a single room, as I find the present sharing arrangement inconvenient.

I must explain that the reason for my dissatisfaction is my roommateâ€™s inconsiderate behaviour. For one thing, his friends are constantly visiting him, for another, he regularly holds noisy parties. In addition, he sometimes borrows my things without asking me. In these circumstances, I find it difficult to concentrate on my studies, and I am falling behind in my assignments.

I am sure you will agree that the only solution is for me to move into a room of my own, where I will be free from such distractions. Therefore, I would be grateful if you could find a single room for me, preferably not in the same building but as near to the college campus as possible.

Yours sincerely,

## Model Answer 2:

Dear Sir,

I am a student in the first term in your college, enrolled for the B.Tech course and currently sharing room no. 301 in the college campus, with a fellow mate who is also pursuing the same course. Sir, I humbly request you to consider my application for allotment of a new room, in the next term.

Though the fellow student with whom I share the room is helpful by nature but the constant visiting of his friends to the room not only creates disturbance but also is a source of continuous breach of my privacy. Moreover, there is an average of one party, in the room, every fortnight. This is yet another source of deviation from my studies.

Sir, my father, despite the financial crunch, did arrange for my higher studies in this reputed college. Consequently, it becomes my moral responsibility to not lose the sight of the dreams which have been conceived in the eyes of my parents. The latest incident wherein he borrowed my laptop, without my permission, forced me to write down this request letter to your attention. The fact that, due to intermittent use of removable disks, my laptop has stopped working and due to this I am not able to cope up with the studies due to non-availability of the notes, only added fuel to the fire.

Sir, in view of all these undesirable and uncomfortable situations, I once again humbly request you to allot a new room to me, in the next term, preferably a single room.

With kind regards,
Kim
