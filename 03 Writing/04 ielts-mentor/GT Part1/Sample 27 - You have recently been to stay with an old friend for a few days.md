Dear Karan,

Hope you are doing good, I am doing well here.

It was indeed a great pleasure to visit you. I can never forget those moments in my life as those were the happiest and memorable moments for me. The way you treated me during my visit is really appreciated. I would like to meet with all our old friends one day. When we went to 'Wonderland', I was simply mesmerised and those are unforgettable moments. We enjoyed there like we were in our school days. I still remember the way you were afraid of water when you were a child. But your personality has been changed with time and you have turned into a very influential person, in my opinion.

It would be a great pleasure to invite you to my home for my birthday next month. We will go to the nearby hill station and have a great fun there. I will expect you to be with me at that time.

 
Best Wishes,
Ram.

Dear Jonathon,
 
I'm writing to thank you for a really enjoyable visit. It was good to see you after a so long and to be able to spend some time with you, talking about old school friends and teachers.

Now that I'm back home, I keep thinking about how good it was to be somewhere quiet and peaceful. I particularly enjoyed our trip to the wildlife sanctuary and appreciated the opportunity to see so many rare birds and animals. It's made me think that I should try and do more to protect them, so I'm having a look on the internet to see what sort of organisation there are.

Perhaps next time we get together you could come and visit me. There are plenty of places we can go and my brother would really like to see you. Let me know when you might be free to come here and we can fix something up.

Look forward to hearing from you soon.
 
Sincerely yours,
Alison Cambell

Dear Mathew,
 
Hi! It has been almost a month since we met in Goa, at your residence, after a long hiatus of probably half a decade. The week which we spent together seems to have vanished in no time.
 
The visit, particularly, to the Church would remain etched in my memory forever. I wish I could make the time stop.
Though all the seven days in your company were absolutely awesome, but the dinner, at ‘The Taj’, was something which was one of the most enjoyable moments, in the recent past.
 
Apart from this, I’d also like to give my sincere thanks for all the co-operation that you extended for arranging a job for my daughter, in Goa.
 
Further, I suppose, you’ve plans to attend the seminar organised by Indian Federation Association in Delhi which is slated in the latter half of the current year. Accordingly, I’d love you to be my guest and stay with my family. This would give me an opportunity to be a good host, apart from being a good friend, as well.
 
Regards
Rahin

Dear Jackol,
I am writing to let you know that we had a great time during my stay in your house last week. You have been very nice to us especially to my mother and my little sister.

I enjoyed the fun-filled trips to the beach, the adventurous hiked to Mt. Samat and the basketball games that we have spent even though we always lose to the opponents. I also like the shirts and delicacies that you brought us from your hometown. I have shared it to some of my friends so that they can also have a taste of it.

I hope that you also enjoyed your stay with us last year and I apologise if my little sister was very talkative every time she saw you. Please visit us again next year so that we can try some of the tourist spots that we have missed this year. We are looking forward to your next visit.

Best Regards,
Tickol

Dear John,
Hope you are doing great. Thanks a million for having me stay at your place over the past week. The stay was amazing, and I had the time of my life when we hopped different places during the stay. It is so sad that it is over!

As you know what an ardent football fan I am, I still cannot get the wonderful memories of that football match that we saw, out of my head. I still get chills on my spine when I think about it. Remember those tantalizing final ten minutes of the game, when Liverpool FC turned it around by scoring two late goals, and then the entire stadium went berserk with joy. I wish I had a video camera to capture those sensational moments!

Anyway, would you fancy dropping by at my place on Sunday afternoon? I am having some high school friends over, and if you could come, that would be simply fantastic as the gathering will turn into our high school reunion. Also, I have not seen some of these guys in ages, so I am pretty sure this is going to be on of a kind of experience for all of us.

I look forward to seeing you soon.

Best regards,
Sam
