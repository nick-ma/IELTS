# 2 weeks ago you bought a radio from a local branch of a well-known chain of shops. It did not work properly. The shop took it back and said they would repair it. You have waited a week and still it is not ready.

Write a letter to the shop complaining. Tell what has happened and how you feel. Ask them to repair the radio very soon or supply you with a new radio.


 
You should write at least 150 words.

## Sample Answer:

Dear Sir/ Madam,

I am writing this letter to inform you that I had given the radio for repair and it is still not ready even after one week.

I had bought the radio from your shop as it is one of the best available shops. But, it was mere disappointment when the brand new radio wasnâ€™t working as it should be. I talked to your representatives in the shop and they agreed to repair it within a couple of days. Now, it has been a week and radio is not yet ready. Whenever I call on shop phone number, one of your salesmen always promises to deliver the radio with in one day. But it was never delivered and all I got is apology and regret.

Please repair the radio by day end today as it is already much delayed. If it is not possible, kindly provide me with a new radio of same branch and model.

Thank You.

Yours faithfully,
"M"
