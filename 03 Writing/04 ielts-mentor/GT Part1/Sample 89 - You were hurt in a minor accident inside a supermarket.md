## Sample Letter Answer 1:

Dear Sir,

I am writing this complaint letter about an accident that happened to me during buying some fresh vegetables from your supermarket.

My name is Shahin, and I am working in a multinational company as an engineer. I live at the opposite side of your supermarket. However, as a regular customer, every weekend it is necessary for me to go to the supermarket for buying some foods, fruits and other necessary items.

Yesterday it was weekend and as usual, I went to the market to buy some fresh vegetables. Suddenly, at the north corner side of the fruit market, a woman collided with me with her shopping bucket at the night time. As you know, at this corner side no one can see each other while walking especially at the night. So, this unavoidable accident occurred as the lack of attention of your management. In addition, there was no electric bulb and the road was slippery. Though this was a minor accident, it could have been worse!

This supermarket is very important for the people because every day thousands of people come here for shopping. You are the manager of this supermarket, and therefore, it is your responsibility to maintenance this place to avoid such accident. Just change the electric bulb and repair the road to avoid the unexpected accidents. I hope you will give your immediate attention to this matter.

Yours faithfully,
 Shahin

## Sample Letter Answer 2:

Dear Sir or madam,

This is “Shadia”, one of the regular customers of your renowned supermarket “Meena Bazar”. Today I am writing to you regarding a minor accident that I had to face while visiting your supermarket last time.

It is a matter of great regret that during my last visit to your Banani branch, I found the frozen food area completely wet and slippery. I guess it might have happened due to the inactive freezing system or any kind of technical issue. Also, the un-dynamic activity of housekeeping team was similarly responsible for it. Unfortunately, I slipped my footstep while passing that area since I did not have any idea in this regard. Although, I had managed my balance but it could have been a serious issue. I noticed many elderly people shop from your supermarket and it is quite unacceptable to have such an area that can possibly cause harm to people.

I believe, Meena Bazar authority is having the best management individuals like you and you would take proper action after getting it notified. Therefore, in the consideration of its good will, you should be more attentive regarding all kind of safety issues like this.

I recommend you, to maintenance all the electronic devices more frequently with professional bodies. Also, you should take necessary steps to hire very  skilled and proactive cleaning team and make sure to  properly train up the existing team.

I hope this matter deserves your sound attention.

Thank you in advance for your cooperation.

Yours sincerely,
“Shadia”
