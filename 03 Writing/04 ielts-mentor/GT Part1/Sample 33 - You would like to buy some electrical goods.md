Dear Sir,

## Model Answer 1:  

Dear Sir,

The undersigned has purchased a studio apartment in your town which is in the vicinity to your shop. I’d like to purchase certain electronic equipment for the house. It includes, apart from the ‘popup toaster’, a hand blender, a microwave oven, a big size mixie, a juicer, a dishwasher and a couple of fans along with a dozen tube lights.

In this context, I’d like you to appraise me regarding their ready availability (off the shelf) in your shop. In the case of an affirmative response, you may also provide a quote for all the above-mentioned items, at the earliest.

On the contrary, if the items are not ex-stock, would it be convenient for you to place an order for the entire lot. You must also mention as regards discounts, if any, provided by your shop in case of cash purchase.

Sir, as I have plans to drop down in a week following this weekend, which happens to arrive on the day after tomorrow, I’d also humbly request you to inform me the duration till the time you will be able to retain the electronic equipment, as required by the undersigned.

I hope you will be able to provide the electric equipment, as listed here above, at almost the same time of my arrival in your town.

With regards
MNO

## Model Answer 2:  

Dear Sir,

I am writing to enquire if you have various electrical goods that I want to buy. I have tried shops in my own town but they don‛t have exactly what I want.

I want the new Sony DVD player, a Technics turntable and a radio with long wave capability. Do you have these items in stock or, if not, will you be able to order them soon? I also need to know what price you charge for these items. If you do have these things, would you be able to hold them for me and for how long? I am free this weekend and, if you have them, I can come over on Saturday morning to pay you and pick them up.

Please write back to me as soon as possible at the above address or call me on my mobile number xxxx- xxx -xxx . I look forward to hearing from you soon.

Yours sincerely,

Andrew Moore.

 

## Model Answer 3:  

Dear Sir,

I am writing to enquire about whether the new ‘Braun Men’s Trimmer’ is available at your store and if it is not available, whether you will be able to order it from another source?
    
I live in a small rural centre near your town, and the paucity of good electric stores in my village means that I am unable to find this trimmer here in my village. I would like to express how important it is for me to find this trimmer since my cousin’s wedding is about to take place in the next few weeks, and to groom myself, I need this trimming machine.

I was hoping that either your store will have this machine or you can source it from somewhere else in case you don’t have it. Further, I would like to know how much this device will cost me and for how long will you be able to hold it for me?

Hoping to hear from you soon,
Sam

## Model Answer 4:  

Dear Sir,

I am writing this letter to get some information about few electrical goods.

I need a microwave oven, a toaster, a 42 inch LED and a fully automatic washing machine. I checked in a couple of shops in my town but they do not have these. One of my friends strongly recommended your shop to purchase these appliances.

Kindly let me know if you have these electronic appliances. In case, if you don’t have any or all of these, would it be possible for you to order these electrical goods on my behalf? I would appreciate if you can tell me about different brands of each item along with their prices. Moreover, please tell me after how many days I can collect my goods? I am asking this as I have to go out of town for few days on a business trip and I am thinking of collecting these on my way back.

I would be obliged if you can hold these items in my absence.

Hope to listen from you soon.

Faithfully,

Mansoor
