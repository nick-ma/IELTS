## Sample Answer:

Dear Harish,

I hope this letter finds you in good health. I would like to take this opportunity to express my gratitude for my stay at your home in Adelaide last weekend, while you were away on the business trip. I had a pleasant time over there.

I find Adelaide is very interesting for shopping. I bought a brand new Rolex wrist watch for my wife, from Rundle street shopping centre. I was actually tempted by the fascinating brown colour strap and square shaped dial. The dial has roman numbers too. I am very excited about it.

Unfortunately, I couldn’t find it in my luggage when I am back to Sydney. I remember that I have kept it in your living room cupboard safe box.  I want to gift it to my wife on her birthday next week and surprise her.

Actually, one of my colleagues is travelling to Sydney from your place this week end. I can request him to collect it from you. He lives just a couple of miles away from your apartment. I will pass your address and contact number to him. I think you can hand it over to him without any trouble. His name is “Brad Ryan”, around 40 years old. Please check his identity card before you hand over the stuff.

I hope to see you soon in Sydney.
                                       
Yours’ Lovingly,

Ramesh NV.
