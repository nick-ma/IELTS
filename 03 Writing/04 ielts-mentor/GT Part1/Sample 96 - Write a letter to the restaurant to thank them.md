## Model Answer 1:

Dear Sir,

I am writing to you to say thanks for organising such a wonderful birthday party of mine. It was a great evening with fascinating arrangements which is still alive in my mind. Here I want to mention some key services you provided us to make this event memorable.

First of all, I would like to mention that the venue was so beautiful that it astonished my family and friends. You provided us a big hall that was decorated with coloured lights and stage, having lots of candles and petals made the arrangements worth saying.

Secondly, I want to comment about foods and other services. The Birthday cake you provided us was so beautiful that it really impressed me and my friends. After that the restaurant severed us Platters, with each thing we imagined was a beautiful addition to the menu in this price. I and all companions really were impressed to see these unique types of paintings around the stage.

Lastly, I want to add some suggestions that will definitely increase the worth of your restaurant around the community, that is, "The live music". If you hired a band to perform live music will improve the excitements in the parties and people will love to choose your restaurant among others.

Once again I am very thankful for admirable services.

Regards,

B

## Model Answer 2:

Dear Sir,

I am Vishwa Vinutna. I had celebrated my birthday party at your restaurant last week with my friends. I am writing this letter to thank you for making it a successful event.

My friends and I enjoyed food at your restaurant. The Cake was so nice and everyone liked it. Your culinary staff is expert at cooking delicious food and satisfied each and everyone’s taste. The food was not only superb but also of reasonable price. Moreover, hotel staff was so polite and very keen to look after the needs of all of us. The service offered is praiseworthy. To add more, the restaurant depicts the nature’s beauty perfectly with full of glistening greenery all around. The soothing and pleasant atmosphere made the event unique and even more attractive.

However, there are some improvements which I suppose makes your restaurant still more appealing. Firstly, the increase in staff members is quite essential. Furthermore, it would be great if you could include a wide variety of cuisines in your menu.

I trust you would accept my suggestions. I look forward to seeing the improvements in the restaurant.

Yours faithfully,

Vishwa Vinutna.

Dear manager,

This is an appreciation letter regarding the service rendered by you and your staff in the last week where I had celebrated my 31st birthday on Thursday.

It gives me an immense pleasure to thank you all for the service rendered to us, firstly to mention is the food of different cuisines wherein we were appalled by the excellent dishes prepared by your cooks on our order. I was so happy when my friends quoted that they had an excellent dish of their likeness and ate up to their stomach full.

Secondly, the prevailing atmosphere in the restaurant was so serene that you and all your staff right from the welcome guy to the stewardess were so cordial that we felt a homely appeal. Need to mention that overall the party was an excellent memoir to be remembered.

I, take this opportunity to mark this letter as a token of appreciation for the success of the birthday party in which your restaurant and your staff played a pivotal role.

Thanking you for your support.

Best wished,

## Model Answer 4:

Dear Sir / Madam,
 
My name is Rona Lyn Olivar. I celebrated my 25th birthday in your restaurant on the 9th of May, and that is just yesterday in the evening with my friends and relatives. The event was a great success and I must say that we really had so much fun that night. I am writing to you today because I want to thank you for the food served, the staff service and the atmosphere.
 
Firstly, the food was amazing. The chicken adobo that was served for us was cooked excellently. The sauce was so creamy and yummy. Secondly, all the restaurant crews were very friendly and accommodating. They smiled at every people inside and always asked how they can help us. And finally, the place gave us the peaceful environment that night. It was a nice atmosphere inside.
 
Because of those things I mentioned, I am recommending you to add more space. This is so because there are many people coming to your restaurant and to accommodate all of them, a more spacious place might be needed.
 
Thank you once again for serving me and my companions last night.
 
Yours faithfully,
R. Olivar
