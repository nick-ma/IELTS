# You are a student at an English language school in Brighton and are living in private accommodation with other flat mates. You have not had hot water or heating for some time. The landlord's workmen have tried to fix the problem but without success.

Write a letter to the landlord. In your letter:

- State your reason for writing
- Describe the problems and explain how you feel
- Propose a solution and risk the landlord to take action

You should write at least 150 words.

## Sample Answer 1:

Dear Mr. Smith,
 
How are you? I am writing this letter in connection to a pesky problem surfaced few days ago in our house on Randal Street, Brighton. The heating system of the home has been non-functional for more than 5 days now.
 
For your information, as per the agreement, we reported the issue to your workmen first. However, they have failed to fix the problem and have exacerbated the situation by drilling some holes in the bathroom wall, channels for cold air to freeze us in this intense winter.
 
Due to the non-functional heating system, we are unable to control water temperature, and we are compelled to heat water using kitchen gas burners for our daily domestic use. Similarly, we can't control even room temperature and we are living with thick winter cloths donned on our body round the clock. This is highly unpleasant and obnoxious to all of us. As a repercussion, two of the flat-mates are currently suffering from high fever and we have arranged their temporary accommodation at a friend's house to recuperate.   
 
In order to fix the issue, all in all I suggest engaging a better maintenance service agency with more skilled professionals than your workmen.  I find many such agencies in our daily newspaper classified.
 
Finally, considering the severity of the trouble, I expect your immediate action and resolution. Also, as per our rental agreement, non- resolution of issues related to facilities within 10 days of report are subjected to stop the payment of rent until issues get resolved.
Hence, please consider this letter as a notice to start the agreed notice period.
 
Yours sincerely
RR

## Sample Answer 2:

Dear Mr. Patrick,

I am Mala, one of the tenants living your flat, located in number 2 flat in Park Road. I am writing this letter with an intention of informing about a problem and to find a solution for that. I and my flat mates faced a severe problem for last three months.

That is in Brighton we have to face cold climate in this season. But we are unable to use hot water in the flat. There was a workman who visited our flat on last Friday. He tried to fix the heater, it was working on that day, but following day, that heater did not work again. We feel it is an everyday problem for us. We are unable to attend to classes in the morning due to this problem.

We hope you could understand our problem and take an action to this problem. I suggest fixing an auto heater to the bathroom and replacing the current one. Since it is too old, it is not possible to repair again and again. If we do not get a proper solution for this problem within two days, all of our friends may vacate your flat. At that time, you may need to repay all the key money which we paid you while renting the flat. Kindly attend to this problem as soon as possible and oblige us.

Thank you

Sincerely,

Mala
