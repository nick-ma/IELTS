Dear Manager,

I am writing to you to get an accommodation at your Hostel during our visit to Snowy Mountains in New South Wales with our group of Students.

I am John, Lecturer at St Joseph’s college in Perth. We are planning to organise a trip to Australia next month from 2nd May to 8th May, and there we would like to visit Snowy Mountains in New South Wales with our student’s group which is located in Western Australia. We thought to stay at your Hostel during this trip to Australia for one week.

We are the group of 20 students and 3 lecturers; require an accommodation of 5 rooms which is enough for us. It would be great if we can get rooms with attached bathroom and kitchen because some of our students prefer to cook themselves.  

Please let us know the availability of accommodation in the mentioned period and booking details if they are available.

Thanking you,

Yours Faithfully,
John.

Dear Manager,
Student Hostel Services,South Avenue -1008

I am writing to seek accommodation in the Snowy Mountains for a group of students from Perth.

We expect to be in the Snowy Mountains between June 1 and June 12. There are fourteen people in our group, five men, seven women and a married couple. The five men will accept dormitory accommodation, and the women are happy to share rooms, but the married couple would like a double room.
We hope to keep our expenses as low as possible.

Please tell me about recreational services in the area. The group will bring their own boots for bushwalking, but we are hoping to hire equipment for other sports, like skiing. Some of our group will want to hire geological picks and other equipment, if possible. We also need to know about access to caves and other interesting geological features in the area.

I am looking forward to receiving information about the Student Hostel Services and other facilities.

Yours sincerely
Adam Smith
