## Sample Answer 1:

Dear XYZ,

Hope you are doing great. As per our earlier discussion, I am writing to refresh your mind that you will be looking after my house and pet during my vacation starting from coming weekend. While you already know my email address (which is abc@yahoo.com), you can contact me there. I will be checking my emails regularly. In case of any emergency, feel free to dial me on my mobile number (as always it is +66- 12345670). I have already prepared the necessary foods for my cat. You will find it inside the fridge and the feeding scheduled has been kept on the back of kitchen door. In the store room, there is a small bed designed for the cat. She usually sleeps around 9:00 pm, so you have to place it in the living room at that time. You are always welcome to use the fridge, foods, TV and other facilities I have at my home.

Moreover, I would appreciate if you do me another favor. Please switch on the garage lights after sun set and turn it off in the morning. Also, pick up the newspaper from the lawn.

Thank You.
Yours sincerely,

R

## Sample Answer 2:

Dear Scarlet,

First, I would like to thank you for agreeing to look after my house and my dog Chi chi. On my entire holiday, I will be staying with my sister in our ancestral house in Vigan. Feel free to give me a ring on my mobile number if you need anything or for some urgent matters. I wrote my address in Vigan and my mobile numbers in the sticky note posted on my fridge.

My dog, Chi chi, needs to be fed twice daily morning and evening. His dog food is inside the drawer beside my coffee maker. You just mix a cup of dog food and a cup of milk, his bowl is located under the dining table. Apparently an hour after eating you need to bring him out in a leash, for a walk for him to defecate. During bedtime, kindly lock him up in his cage in the front yard and make sure that he has a bowl of fresh water. Don't bother to wash him up I will be the one to it once I return.

Moreover, regards the house kindly water the pants that is located in the kitchen and living room at least twice a day. Kindly unplugged all the appliances and turn off my water source. Lastly, for security purpose kindly make sure that the doors and windows were properly locked and please turn on the lights outside at night.

Thank you so much! I'm looking forward to see you when I come back. I'll make sure to pick up some souvenirs for you.

Yours,

Arlyn
