## Sample Answer 1:

Dear Sir / Madam,

I am Mrs. Renu from Kandy Women Development Organization. I went through your advertisement dated on 2nd March 2016 and writing this letter with the intention to inform about a person deserves for the reward mentioned in the advertisement.

My organisation’ director, Mrs. Hemamali, is the person I would like to suggest for this reward. She has been working for the widow women in the society more than last 30 years.  She is a capable, experienced and talented woman suitable to receive this reward.

A woman knows another woman’s difficulties than a man. She utilises her time for other needy women.  Not only as an organisation’s director but also personally she has supported many widows and needy women, living in remote areas. By her talent of need identification and support them according to their requirements, she became a volunteer leader in the society. She never differentiates people based on their race, religion, disability and colour. That is, she treats all equally and she is an exemplary personality to many.

I would like to suggest a reward for this excellent lady; a trophy printed her name and her service for the community. This should be an award for her lifetime achievement. Not only me but also many women who obtained supports through her would be happy if she receives this reward. We would be highly thankful if you could nominate Mrs. Hemamali also in your list.

Thank you

Sincerely,
M. M. Renu
