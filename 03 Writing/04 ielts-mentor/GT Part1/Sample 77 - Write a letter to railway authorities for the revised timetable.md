You should write at least 150 words.

## Sample Answer:

Dear Sir/ Madam,
My name is Ravibabu and I am currently residing at Seven Hills. I use trains to commute for my work and the recently changed train timetable causes problem to get to my work on time.

I used to get the train at 7:40 am from Seven Hills and usually reached at my destination around 8:50 am and it was about five minutes walk from the station to my workplace. It was more convenient to reach my office on time.  

The 7:40 AM train no longer stops at my station and I am forced to take either 7:15 AM or 7:58 AM train. If I am taking the train at 7:58 AM and arrive at my workplace by only 9:05 which is late for my office. The 7:15 AM train is too early to get in. I also checked with fellow passengers who are also struggling to get to the work on time.

I request you revisit revised train timings and reinstate 7:40 AM train to stop at our station, which will enable me or fellow passengers to travel to work on time.

I am looking forward to hearing a positive reply.

Yours Sincerely,
Ravibabu
