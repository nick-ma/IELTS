## Sample Answer 1:

Dear Sir/Madam,

I am writing to you to thank you for the fantastic food and service delivered on my birthday.

I visited your restaurant on 30th December with my friends to celebrate my birthday; and all of us were very impressed with the overall experience. Food was delicious and well presented. I must mention the “Chicken Tandoori” dish that was served to us was star of the evening, cooked to perfection and absolutely mind blowing.

I really enjoyed the live music that was being played, it lightened up the whole ambience and I also liked the “Retro theme” of the restaurant. We were also very pleased with the service; all the staff members were friendly, attentive and served us with smile. Our waiter, also made few recommendations for drinks, which were good and something we have not tried before.

Though, I would like to give one suggestion, as your restaurant is a non-smoking zone, it would be great, if you could also have a separate smoking area, where people can enjoy their meal and smoke at the same time. I am sure your customers will like this arrangement. Other than that, everything was perfect.

Thanks for making my birthday party memorable. My friends and I enjoyed it very much.

I will definitely recommend your restaurant to my friends and family.

Regards,
P

Dear Sir/Madam,

I am writing you this letter to thank you for your amazing service at the steak restaurant. My friends and I were celebrating my birthday last week at your restaurant and we enjoyed our time a lot. Your food is really good and has a special taste, every one of us really wanted to go back and try it again.

I also would like to take a moment to appreciate the great service by your employees. Although it was crowded, they were always available, smiling and made us feel welcomed and comfortable.

Last but not least, the atmosphere in the restaurant was really pleasant and we specially enjoyed the classical music you had in your playlist.

Finally, I think it would be great if you have more variety in beverage and desserts menus.

Again, thank you for this nice experience. We are definitely coming back.

Best Regards,

## Sample Answer 3:

Dear Sir,

I am one of your regular visitors who had a birthday celebration at your renowned restaurant last week. I would like to thank you for the wonderful hospitality offered at your place.

All the arrangements were done perfectly. We enjoyed the scrumptious food served to us including both vegetarian and non-vegetarian. Moreover, I am impressed with the politeness and the prompt service of your staff. The background lightning and music played that day was amazing, adding more to the ambience of the hall.

However, I would like to make some suggestions. The plants around the driveway need little more attention. They are not in very appealing state! In addition to that some crockery items have slight cracks and needs to be replaced.

I hope that you will personally look into the matter and make possible rectifications in interest of your business and valued customers.

Sincerely yours,
Karl Mark

Dear Sir or Madam,
 
My name is Rona Lyn Olivar. I celebrated my 25th birthday in your restaurant on the 9th of May, and that is just yesterday in the evening with my friends and relatives. The event was a great success and I must say that we really had so much fun that night. I am writing to you today because I want to thank you for the food served, the staff service and the atmosphere.
 
Firstly, the food was amazing. The chicken adobo that was served for us was cooked excellently. The sauce was so creamy and yummy. Secondly, all the restaurant crews were very friendly and accommodating. They smiled at every people inside and always asked how they can help us. And finally, the place gave us the peaceful environment that night. It was a nice atmosphere inside.
 
Because of those things I mentioned, I am recommending you to add more space. This is so because there are many people coming to your restaurant and to accommodate all of them, a more spacious place might be needed.
 
Thank you once again for serving me and my companions last night.
 

Yours faithfully,
R. Olivar
