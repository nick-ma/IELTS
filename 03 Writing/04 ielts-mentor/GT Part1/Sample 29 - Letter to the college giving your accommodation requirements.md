Dear Sir/Madam;

I am Johnny who will join your college next year and I am writing to you to reserve a dorm in advance because I prefer to stay in a college Hall of Residence.

According to the dorm introduction on the college website, I would like to choose the two-beds room on the third floor with air-conditioner and laundry machine if there is still any vacancy. If all of them are reserved, it is fine for me to get the three or four beds room as well, but the air-conditioner and laundry machine are indispensable as they are the foremost factors I would consider.

As I am a vegetarian, I would like to know if the college provides food for people like me.  If this kind of food is unavailable, would you tell me any restaurant near the college can provide? I will really appreciate if you can share that information with me.

Looking forward to your reply!
 
Yours sincerely
Johnny

## Model Answer 2:
Sir,

I have just recently been awarded a place at your esteemed college and I now write with respect to my accommodation requirements for my first initial year.

As I will not know anyone at the College, I would like to spend my first year in a Hall of Residence so that I can meet people in this place. I would prefer the Hall to be a single sex female-only hall and with the full board so that I won't have to worry about cooking for myself. In addition,  require a vegetarian choice as I am vegetarian. If there are no halls offering the above then I would be satisfied in a hall with kitchens so I can cook. Additionally, I would not like to share my room and I would prefer en suite facilities if you have halls offering this.

Thanking you for your assistance in advance, I look forward to hearing from you soon.

Yours sincerely,

Lee Harper.
