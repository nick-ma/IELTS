## Model Answer 1:

Dear Mr. Moore

I am Sam Emanuel. I read your job advertisement for hiring a waiter/waitress in your restaurant through Weekly Job magazine. I would like to apply for the position as my experience and personal qualities would make me a good candidate for the opening.

Currently, I am studying Hotel Management course at the TianJin University. I want to utilise my summer holidays doing working in an industry related to my studies. I have experience working as a waiter at a local restaurant for about 5 months. My responsibilities involved taking orders and making sure that customers at my tables got their orders on time. In addition, I also worked as a bartender at a bar in downtown for three months.

I am hard-working and punctual. All of my previous employers would be willing to give me a good reference if needed be. Also, I am quite flexible and able to do all sorts of tasks. And my previous waiter experience would allow me to easily set in the vacancy at your restaurant.

Please let me know if you think I am a suitable person for this job. If so, I am able to come for an interview anytime of the day.

Yours faithfully,
Sandeep

Dear Mr. Moore,

Re: Waitress position

I am writing to express my interest in your recently advertised position for a waitress. Enclosed with this letter is my resume, which further details of my previous experience and qualifications.

Not only do my qualifications and work experience make me a perfect candidate for the job, my personality is well suited to working as a waitress. I am a very friendly person who can quickly establish rapport with people of all ages. In my last waitress job, I had over a dozen repeat customers each day. And, the fast-paced environment of waiting on tables suits me well, because I thrive on working under pressure. In fact, my former boss was surprised at both my incredible stamina and efficiency in dealing with customers’ orders.

I would like to meet with you at your earliest convenience, to discuss the possibility of working at your restaurant. I can be reached at 463-9234 during the days and 924-6868 after 6 pm.

Thank you for your consideration of my application. I look forward to meeting you in the near future.

Yours sincerely,

Emmie Lawren.

Dear Mr. Moore,

This is in reference to the job of a waiter, for evening work, as advertised in the ‘job hunt’ column of the local tabloid by your hotel, the XAW.

In this context, I’d like to forward my resume for your kind perusal. Furthermore, I’d also be pleased to inform you that I do possess the requisite experience in the field of the hospitality industry. I’ve been serving the UVW chain of hotels since the past half a decade, in the capacity of a Waiter. I further feel a pride of sense in informing you that I’ve been awarded the best employee of the year award, for my department, consecutively for three years prior to the previous year.

However, since my spouse is on the family way and lives in the city where your hotel requires waiters, albeit for evening works, I am calling it a day from the UVW chain of hotels.

Sir, by the virtue of this letter, I’d like to apply for the required post in your hotel. As regards my experience and referrals from UVW chain of hotels, I would be rather more than glad to provide you the documents.

Furthermore, I sincerely look forward to a long-term relationship nurturing amongst us.

With regards
MNO.

## Model Answer 4:

Dear Sir/Madam,

The reason for writing this letter is to apply for the evening job of a waiter at your Restaurant. I am 21 years old, studying at the University and have previous work experience as a waiter.

I have worked at many evening Restaurants before and have experience of working in a bar also. Once, I was the in charge of the Poolside Bar & Dinner area at a popular hotel. Also, I have expertise in noticing client requirements very quickly. Alongside this, I have skills of catering customers during peak rush hour.

I am sure, my six-month diploma in Hotel Management will be an advantage to the restaurant if you hire me. At the same time, I also need to know the Roles/Job responsibility you are looking in the person and also the work timing in the evening, as being a student and study conscious, it is really important to know the closing time of restaurant.

Thanks for reading my application. Looking forward to working with you.

Yours Truly
Rahul Choudhary
