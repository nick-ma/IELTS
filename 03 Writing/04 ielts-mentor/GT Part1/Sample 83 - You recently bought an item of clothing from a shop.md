# You recently bought an item of clothing from a shop. You discovered that it had a fault and returned it to the shop for replacement or refund. However, the assistant told you that this was against the store's policy.

Write a letter to the store manager, explaining the problems you have had. Ask for a refund or exchange on the item.

## Sample Answer:

To the Manager,
A2A Fashion House,
Elizabeth Super Market.

I am, Naaz, a regular customer of your store situated in Elizabeth supermarket building. I am very impressed with the unique and latest trendy collection of your store. I am writing this letter to inform you that my last shopping experience was not very satisfactory.

I bought a white colour top from your store on 14t April. When I tried it in the shop, it was perfectly alright. However, when I showed it to my roommate I realised that there is a stain on the back side of the top. It is such a big stain that it could not be ignored. I believe it was exchanged with the defective piece during the billing. I immediately went to the store to get it replaced. However, the assistant mentioned that once the item is sold it cannot be exchanged or refunded as per the store's policy. I completely understand it. However, it is unfair that a customer has to suffer due to the staff's mistake. I have not removed the price tag also from the top and it is clearly visible that the stain is very old.

I believe this matter deserve your immediate attention. I would appreciate if you could replace the top. It would certainly increase my confidence towards your customer care services as well.

Looking forward to your prompt action,

Naaz
(Customer ID as mentioned in your Store card: 2457)
