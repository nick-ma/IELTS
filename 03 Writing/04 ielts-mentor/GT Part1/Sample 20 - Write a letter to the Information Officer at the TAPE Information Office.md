## Model Answer 1:

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Rona Lyn Olivar. I am writing to you today because I need information regarding your TAPE Tertiary Preparation certificate. I have finished my elementary in an exclusive girlâ€™s school called Montessori Elementary that is situated in Baguio City, Philippines and graduated with honours on the 30th of March, in Saint Louis University located also in the same city.

I want to prepare for my college that is why I want to do a tertiary preparation in your institution. I want to know what sort of preparation your office will be given us and what are the things needed while attending your preparatory program. I also want to know if you have a specific preparation course for a certain course. For instance, I am planning to take an architectural study because this has always been my dream since I was in my primary schooling.

I look forward to your immediate response with regards to my concerns.
 
Yours faithfully,
R. Oliver

## Model Answer 2:

Dear Sir/Madam,

I would like some information about the Tertiary Preparation Certificate. If possible I would like to enrol in this course as a part-time student in 1992. I left school eight years ago after completing the 1ISC. Since then I have worked as a sales assistant in both Grace Bros and David Jones. From the beginning of this year, I have been in charge of the Children's Wear Department in Grace Bros, Lilyfield.

However, in order to advance any further in my career into a managerial position, I will need to do some further study, such as a Marketing or Business Course. Because I have not studied for many years, I believe that I should complete the TPC before enrolling in a Business course.

Could you please send me the information as soon as possible, and tell me the dates for enrolling in the Tertiary Preparation Certificate.

Yours faithfully

Ronald Young
