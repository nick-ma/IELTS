Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to raise my concern about the dish I was served in your restaurant on last Sunday. I am Lattisha James, visited your restaurant on last Sunday for dinner with my family. I came there because I did shopping at the Ansar mall, near to your restaurant, and I heard much about your restaurant in the radio advertisement.

When we came there, we saw a special menu written on a board and kept in front of the restaurant and name of that dish was Chettinadu fish curry. Therefore, we decided to taste that and we ordered rice with this fish curry. When we got that food, we found chilli powder on the surface of the fish and we enquired about that and one of your employees told they keep it off one hour after marinating with chilli  powder with some other ingredients. Even though we felt bad, our children had it because they like fish curry. Unfortunately, my son had severe vomiting after we reach home and admitted to hospital for one day.

I will appreciate you if you could have taken an action about this inconvenience we had due to the food. Please instruct your chefs to follow a good hygienic manner and if they do not know to make such kind of food please do not offer it to the customers because it will affect your prosperity and our health.

I hope you will take this matter seriously and will take a proper action.

Yours sincerely,

Lettisha

Dear Sir or Madam,

On January 9th my family and I visited your establishment to have a traditional celebration of my sister’s birthday. Since she lives in France we annually go to this restaurant, because we always considered it as the most classy French cuisine place. Having the onion soup there is also our family tradition because my sister loved it very much before her moving to France. I suppose, you can imagine our disappointment when we found the onion soup absolutely inedible last time. Firstly, it was cold. Secondly, it seemed your chef did not stir it well while cooking, so there were some clogs of flour. The last but not the least, its taste made us feel that the cook used artificial instant soup base. We asked our waitress about the reasons soup is so awful and she told the cook of the current shift has changed and this is the vision of the soup of the new one.

It is highly unlikely this new chef with his vision is suitable for such famous restaurant as yours. I recommend changing or sending him to training in order your customers could further enjoy genuine French cuisine.

Faithfully yours,

Elizabeth Harley

Dear Sir/ Madam,

My name is Rona Lyn Olivar. I am one of your regular customers in your Cozy-Place restaurant, and I am writing to you today to complain about the disgusting meals and desserts that have been served to me and to my family who were with me yesterday for our dinner.

I, my husband and my two children went to your restaurant at around 7 o'clock to have a dinner and to celebrate my husband's promotion from his company. It was supposed to be a happy and memorable night because we were celebrating together as a family in our then most favourite restaurant. But what happened is indeed a bad experience because it is very disappointing.

My husband and I ordered beef steak for our main course, but the steak was so hard to chew and it actually tasted too salty. Even after we told this to the waiter on duty that time, he did not mind us at all and instead told us to complain to the manager. Another thing is that the ice cream shake that my children have ordered was no marshmallows on top, despite the fact that there should be as stated in your menu. This is really very annoying in our part.

I demand a full refund of the cost of the meals and the desserts that we have ordered as compensation to the disgusting situation we had in your restaurant.

I look forward to your immediate response regarding this matter.

Yours faithfully,

R.Olivar

To
The Manager
Barbeque Restaurant and Bar Indore

Sub: Customer Feedback

Sir,

I am Gagan Bhatia, a resident of the same locality where you’re renown Restaurant “Barbeque” is located. I had visited the place with my family to celebrate my 1st anniversary. I often visit your restaurant due to Ambience, Hygiene, Staff Behaviour & above all the complimentary drinks served with the delicious meals. But, last night it was a big disappointment as firstly, I had my tables booked well in advance but it was allocated to some renowned personality which is not at all acceptable as it hurts customer belief in the service.

Moreover, service was not as per standard and our order took far more than the usual time which was quite annoying. I am a regular customer of your restaurant and if this is what you are going to continue in future then you may lose big business.

Yours Sincerely,

Gagan Bhatia.

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am a regular diner at your restaurant on the Madison Avenue. I am writing to express my dissatisfaction with a meal that I treated my family to at your restaurant.

Recently, I was promoted to the post of Senior Internal Auditor in my organisation. Therefore, I decided to celebrate this event with my family and took them out to one of your outlets at Madison Avenue. We ordered four servings of shrimp fried rice, but we were shocked to discover that most of the shrimp in all of our servings was uncooked and had a very pungent odour. After complaining about it to the supervisor, we were told that the restaurant had run out of shrimps and that we will have to be content with what we were served. You can understand my frustration when my family and I had to leave the restaurant with an empty stomach and disappointment. And as a result, my mother had to cook some food herself when we got back home.

My intention in writing this letter is to ask you to issue a show cause notice to the supervisor at your restaurant, and disseminate instructions to all your staff to hold a modicum of buffer stock for every item, just in case the restaurant runs out of that item so that no other customers will have to experience the humiliation like the way we did.

Yours sincerely,

Muhammad Sameed

Dear sir/madam,

On May 10th, 2016, Saturday, my wife and I visited your restaurant to celebrate our third wedding anniversary. Unfortunately, we had a very negative experience due to bad meals and dessert that had been served.

My wife and I arrived in your restaurant at around 6 pm. We ordered Doro wet for our main course, but the taste was bitter, which actually ruined our dining experience. Even after we told this to the waiter on duty that time, he did not mind us and instead told us to complain to the manager. Another thing is that fruit punch that my wife ordered had no orange juice in it despite the fact that there should have been as stated in your menu. This was a very annoying and negative experience for us.

I demand a full refund of the cost of the meals and desserts that we ordered as compensation to the bad situation and experience we had in your restaurant. I also want you to take actions against the waiter who denied listening to our complaints.

I look forward to seeing you take immediate action regarding this matter.

Yours faithfully,

K. Henok.
