## Model Answer 1:

Dear Mr Chen,
 
My name is Rona Lyn Olivar. I am one of your part-time receptionists in your Brighthand hotel for 2 weeks now. I am writing to you today because of the two problems I have encountered in the reception area that you are not aware of.

Firstly, duty staffs at night shift are always inside of the hotel's quarters sleeping. Only I and Lindsay who is also new in the area are working at night time. Even if we knock them at their door when there were many guests arrived on Saturday evening, they still did not mind us. This happens 3 times already and I think you must know it.

Secondly, the food items that are supposed to be cooked for the hotel customers were eaten by some of the head staffs. One of the breakfast meals that were not eaten by one of the guests were brought to the staff quarters and ate by the head. I believe this is against the rule of the company.

I think they should be reprimanded so that they should learn their lesson and **I look forward to your response regarding this matter**.
 
 
Yours sincerely,
R.Olivar

Dear Mr Adison,

I am a part-time call centre operator at your company, started working about 4 weeks ago. I am writing to indicate the problem I encountered during my work.

Actually, I decided to took the position of a telesales specialist because consider myself able to develop a career in sales due to my skill of establishing good contact with people and make them trust me. However, I realised there are some obstacles on a way to success.

The problems started 3 weeks ago then the system administrator updated my software. At the time of a call I was querying a customer for his personal data then suddenly my computer reloaded and this person’s profile was lost. This situation repeated in the future for several times. I asked the system administrator to solve this problem, but he told me this is solely my fault and my computer skills are below required to use this program.

I am assured the complete situation makes company profits lower. I believe that software managing specialist could fix the problem if the initiative would be taken by a senior manager of your rank.

Sincerely yours,

Ben Flip

Dear Mr Patrick,

I am writing to raise a concern about the problems faced by me in the job at your company. I am Riya, have joined your company as a computer operator six weeks back as a part-timer to fund my internship in software programming course.

I was told at the time of joining that the working hours would be from 5 to 8 pm so I agreed to do this job as it fits well into my daily schedule. However, from the past 2 weeks, customer calls have increased a lot during post lunch hours due to the upcoming events in the city. Unfortunately, my college ends at 4 pm and it’s impossible for me to reach 2 hours early daily. Although, I had managed to work extra time until the last week by missing few lectures at college but it seems unmanageable in future as this affects my studies.

Thus, I would appreciate if you could allow an addition of one more person in the team until the end of the events in the city. It will also be very helpful if we can devise a new organised way to handle high customer calls. We can discuss this new process tomorrow at your convenient time.

Looking forward to meeting you soon.

Yours sincerely,

Riya

## Model Answer 4:

Dear Mr James,

I'm writing to thank again for giving me the opportunity to work in your company and ask you to help me in some problems which I have had over last several weeks with my job.

As you know I have been working as a cost-benefit analyst in the project management office from 20th September three days per week. Recently our office head has wanted me to work four days per week which is against our work contract. However; I would like to work in your company whole of the week as it causes me to earn more money  and I would find more valuable experience, It would be conflicting with my education program as I need to go to my courses in Wednesdays and Fridays.

Also, the office head had promised me to allocate a desktop computer for analysing project data which is still not performed. In fact, I am using my own laptop to work with the Preamovera Software and I am always worried about losing project data if some technical problems come to existence.

I hope that these not make you any difficulties and you would allow me to work according to our primary work contract and would provide a desktop computer.

I look forward to hearing from you in the near future.

Yours faithfully

Milad Rahimi

## Model Answer 5:

Dear Sir/ Madam,

With due respect, I would like to inform you that, I have joined in your company as a part-time employee a few weeks ago. I had to take the job due to internship program which is required to complete my university study.

However, during this short span of my work I have noticed some difficulties with the job of an analyst. Since my job is to help the analysts for collecting different data from various sources as per their requirement, I had to collect same data many times. The main reason behind this redundant work is the lack of MIS reporting software and database. There are lots of benefits that can be taken by using that type of software. It helps to archive data in a systematic way which can be retrieved later easily. This not only helps to reduce redundancy of work but increases the efficiency of analysts. Though purchasing the MIS reporting software is a little bit costly, it will help you to spend more time for analysis and generate quality analytical report also.

Therefore, I request you to invest for purchasing an MIS software which will be a bit costly for you in the short the run but you will have several times of return in future.

Yours faithfully,

Safayet Ullah

## Model Answer 6:


 
Dear Mr  Lim,

I’m writing this letter to raise my concern regarding some of the problems that I encountered during my work in your company. I have been working in your company for almost 5 weeks already as a call centre agent and I’m doing it on a part-time basis because I have to attend also my classes on my master’s degree course. I took the job as I believed it will enhance my communication and public speaking skill and increase my confidence in socialising with other people in an addendum to supporting my studies.

During the first week, everything went fine. But from my second week, I started facing some unavoidable issues. My computer software automatically shuts down as I communicate with a customer. It happened almost every day. I’ve already raised this problem to the technician in charge of the computer and software problems. They’ve tried to fix it but it keeps on happening. What I hate about it is that the guy is blaming me for not having the enough skills on computers and I’m the one liable for it!!! Also, I was supposed to be dropped off every day but no car is picking me up at the end of the office.

I’m confident enough that the computer software problem is not at all my fault. I’m concern about it because my overall performance has already been affected by it. It would be easier if a new computer is provided to me or make sure the fix is done properly. Also please try to arrange my transportation, at least to drop me off at the end of the office.

I’m hoping for your immediate response on this matter.

Respectfully Yours,
Christine Hazel Cac.
