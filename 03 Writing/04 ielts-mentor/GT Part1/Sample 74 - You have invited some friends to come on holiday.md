## Sample Answer:

Dear Annie,

I hope you are as excited to come to Bangalore as I am to receive you. I received your letter where you have asked the direction for my house. But please do not worry; I will come to airport to pick you all. I am sure you all will be tired of travelling and I do not want you to go through the hassle of hiring a can and giving them directions.

I am really looking forward to your visit and have planned few things. We can go to Mysore for a day trip. Mysore has a beautiful palace and a Zoo; which is a house of some exotic animals. Then I have also planned of 3 day trip to Ooty. Ooty is known as "Queens of hills" and have pristine tea gardens and mesmerizing views. I am sure you al will love it.

Since Ooty is a cold hilly place, so please get some winter clothing and comfortable shoes. One thick jacket and a sweater would be good. Also as you know, Bangaloreans speak Kannada, I would be good, if you could learn basic Kannada words and numbers. You might find it useful when travelling alone in Bangalore.

Looking forward to meeting you soon.

Regards,

Preeti
