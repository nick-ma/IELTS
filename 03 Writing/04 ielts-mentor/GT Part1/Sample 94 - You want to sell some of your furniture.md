Dear Karim,

How are you? Hope you are well. I'm writing this letter to let you know that I want to sell some furniture of my house. You know that I've recently transferred to the Rajshahi city from Bogra. It's great news for me because it was my dream to live in Rajshahi city. However, there's one problem that I've already selected a flat, where I wish to stay; but the problem is the dining room that is too small than our previous home. Therefore, I want to sell my dining table, dining set and other furniture related to the kitchen.

Last month, you came to my house when my younger daughter had her 2nd birthday. At that time, you looked my dining table and other kitchen appliances and you praised it. Nevertheless, it's a large table including six chairs, all are in good condition. I prefer to you because I would like to sell this furniture to my friend rather than any unknown person.

Can you come in my house at the next weekend in the afternoon, and again look at my dining table? If you feel that it's perfect for you, you can buy this furniture. Don't need to worry about the price.

No more today, speak you soon.
 
Best wishes,

Rahim
