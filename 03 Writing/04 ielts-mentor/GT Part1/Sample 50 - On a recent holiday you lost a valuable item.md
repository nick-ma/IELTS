## Answer 1: 
Dear Sir/madam,

I am writing this letter to you inform you about a mobile phone that I lost during my holiday trip when I was in Pondicherry. The mobile phone is an Apple iPhone, its price is approximately 70,000 rupees and is of black colour. I had an insurance coverage for my mobile phone from your insurance company.

The incident occurred when I was on a holiday trip in Pondicherry between 28 January 2017 to 31 January 2017. I was on Paradise beach on 30 January 2017 when I lost my mobile phone in the sand. I had made efforts in searching the mobile phone but was not successful in finding it. Since I lost the mobile phone I lodged FIR in the nearest police station.

Since I hold an insurance cover for the mobile phone I would like to claim the insurance amount for the lost phone. As per the policies of the insurance, I am liable to claim an amount of 62000 as an insurance cover for the mobile lost. Also please find the invoice and the FIR copy for the lost mobile phone along with this letter.

I look forward to hearing from you.

Regards,

Aakash.
