Dear Sir/Madam,
I am writing to apply for the holiday job at your City Museum shop that was posted in newspaper last week.  I am a student at the local Lincon College studying history major. We are currently in our summer break and I was hoping to gain some valuable work experience related to my field during this time.

We will have summer holidays from 1st June to 30th August. I will be free during these days so I would be able to work full time or part time as per your requirements. I worked in a local history Museum in my hometown for 6 months. In addition to that, I am quite good with computers and numbers. I believe I would be a great asset for you.
I have been interested in history since I was a child. There is no Museum in this city that I haven't been to. I love your Museum as it has wide variety of historical objects and abundant audio-visual library to read in.

I believe that my enthusiasm for history and relevant skills will make me a good candidate for this position. Please let me know if I am suitable for the job. I am able to appear for interview at any appointed time.

Yours Faithfully,
