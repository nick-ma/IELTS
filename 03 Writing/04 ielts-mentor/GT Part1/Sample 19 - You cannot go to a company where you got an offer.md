## Model Answer 1:

Dear Sir/ Madam,
 
I am writing to inform you that I have received your company's offer for a landscape designer position but I am sorry to say that I need to decline it.
    
I have known your company for decades and I have heard of the great projects that your company has recently completed. I appreciate your time on checking my portfolio online and I was flattered when I received your invitation. Honestly, it took me one week to weigh in my options.    

At the end of the day, I decided to decline the offer because I am happy with my achievements and role now in my recent company. Besides that, I also have big on-going projects that I want to finish to add to my portfolio before I will decide to explore other job opportunities.
 
I hope that in the future I will have a chance to work and be a part of the success of your growing company.
 
Respectfully Yours,

Dear Sir,

I am writing this letter to inform about exquisite job offered which was provided by you last week.  Unfortunately, I have got ample opportunity from my current company which leads to me excuse your offer.

I, Mr. Shah who had faced an interview at your company and 200AJ is the reference number for it. Actually, I was impressed by your interview panel that seemed very knowledgeable and expert in their works.  I was entertained by your team with lots of cooperation and support during that time.  Finally, I had been informed by one of the interviewers that I was shortlisted for this opportunity and HR Manager will contact me for final procedure.  

After your final conversation, I had come to the point that the offered package and responsibilities are not fulfilling my future growth. Simultaneously, in my current company, they are happily ready to increase my pay and also offered me a higher post which I deserve by this time. Finally, I am thankful to you that you have given me this prospect.  However, due to some personal circumstances, I could not reach there and I have no other way but to decline your offer.
I would expect your kind support on this stage.

Yours Faithfully,
Jayesh

## Model Answer 3:

Dear Sir/Madam,

I was a potential employee to whom you made a job offer. I would like to extend my thanks for such an offer, especially at such a company as yours. It is, however, with the deepest regret that I must decline your generous invitation and apologise for any inconvenience I may have caused.

I appreciate immensely the interview organised by your company and the extensive effort made by all the staff involved. Their attitude was impressive and highly commendable. As such I must pass my sincerest apologies for any difficulties related to the extra work that must have been involved, and the time wasted on your behalf. Although the offer was substantial, it wasnâ€™t enough to encourage me to sever the bonds with my current employer. During my time at my present company, my superiors supported me and fostered my career. In short, they made me the employee I am today.

I would like to keep the lines of communication open between our two parties and look forward to further correspondence.

Yours sincerely
Juan Carter

## Model Answer 4:

Dear Sir,

Thank you for considering me as a suitable candidate for the position of assistant manager in your organisation and in fact I was very eagerly waiting for your call last week to be selected as an employee in your organisation.

However, I am very sorry to say that I would not be able to join your organisation due to some unavoidable situations. There are a couple of primary reasons why I am denying this job offer:  one of them is being the job location offered and the other being the salary offered. Apart from these, there are a few other reasons due to which I find my current job more exciting and beneficial.

In my current job I have flexible timing which allows me to keep a balance between my personal and professional life. Also, I am due for a promotion this year and I am expecting a managerial role to come my way soon. The roles and responsibilities of this new position would be very challenging and to fulfil them with a known team would be an added advantage if I stay back in my organisation.

So in a nutshell, thank you for the job offer but I would like to stay with my current organisation and I am humbly declining the offer from your organisation.
                       
Regards

Sam Johnson.
