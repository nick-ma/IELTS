## Sample Answer 1:

Dear Kathy,

Hope you are doing well. It has been a long time that we have not written a letter to each other. I am writing this letter to let you know that I have recently changed my job.

Though I was satisfied professionally with my previous company, it was hard for me to balance the professional and personal life. Long working hours were not allowing me to get some time for myself. Moreover, I was looking for an opportunity which allows me to grow in people management area along with technical skills. The new company offers both. I am responsible for the project deliverables as well as the need to lead a team of five people. I am truly excited about this new role.

I also wanted to inform you that I finally bought a car. It is a second-hand car, however; it is in a very good condition. I enjoy a daily drive to work.

I look forward to knowing the update at your end.

Yours faithfully,
Naaz

Dear Jane,

Hi there. Hope you're doing well. It's been so long since I've heard from you. I was just thinking of you the other day when I saw my neighbourhood's garden of tulips. I am delightful to tell you that I recently moved here in Ottawa three months ago.

As you know, it is one of my biggest dreams to finally settle to this place with my family. I got a wonderful job offer from one of the prestigious hospital here in Ottawa, so here I am. This place is absolutely amazing and the people are very much friendly, kind and accommodating. Aside from that, Ottawa is celebrating Tulip festival annually in the month of May, during springtime. I know you are fond and eager to see a garden of tulips. There are so many varieties of tulips in this place. I bet you would definitely like it here.
    
So far, Iâ€™m enjoying life here and all the new experiences. I hope you could visit us one of these days. How are things back home in the Philippines? What's new with you? I look forward to hearing from you soon.

Best Wishes,
Eva

Dear Ali,

I hope this finds you and your family well. I apologise because I have not been in touch with you for such a long time. I am writing to let you know about my new job.

As you know, I had been working over ten years in the field of strategic planning for an after sale automotive company. Unfortunately, my working place moved to the western side of the city recently, which led me to some complications in terms of transportation. Thus, I was forced to make some changes about my job, as I would not be able to move to a new home. To cut the long story short, I applied for a new position advertised in the newspaper and finally I got the new job.

On the plus side, my new duties mostly fit my particular skills, which hopefully facilitate my upgrading as well as raising salary.

By the way, I almost forgot. My wife is going to take a birthday party for me on next weekend. We would be grateful if you could possibly attend it.

I look forward to hearing from you.

Best Regards,
Behzad
