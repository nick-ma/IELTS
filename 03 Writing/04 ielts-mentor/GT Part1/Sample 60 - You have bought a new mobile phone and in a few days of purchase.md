## Sample Answer 1:

Dear Sir/ Madam,

I am writing to you to apprise you of a faulty mobile purchase.

I am Preeti Ghuraiya, resident of Bangalore and I bought a Samsung Note 2 16GB mobile from your authorize dealer at city centre on 1st of Dec, 2014. Though, I properly checked the mobile while purchasing but merely after few days, problems that started to arise.

Mobile camera suddenly stopped working and I am also experiencing issue with the touch screen.
I haven't store much data on the phone but then also the mobile speed (performance) has reduced drastically as compared to when I bought it. I did report this issue to your customer care, 1 week ago, and I was promised that the phone would be collected and repaired. Complaint number: sum123.However, no action was taken.

I would highly appreciate, if you could look into this matter. My phone is still under warranty and I would like you to replace this faulty set with a new one.
Please find enclosed the copy of purchase bill.

Looking forward to a swift action on this.


Sincerely,
Preeti

## Sample Answer 2:

Dear Sir,

I am writing you this letter to register my complaint regarding a cell phone that I purchased two weeks back.

Half a month back I came at your authorized shop situated in Park Lane and I purchased a new Samsung Galaxy S6 mobile phone with one year warranty. Before that I have been coming to your shop for purchasing other electronic gadgets. However, this experience has been quite bitter for me as just after ten days the mobile stopped functioning and despite my number of attempts I couldn’t switched it ON. Immediately, I visited your sales center, explained the staff present there about the issue and submitted my set for claiming warranty. The representative promised that the mobile phone will be repaired and delivered at my home within 2 to 3 days. Unfortunately, the promise has been fulfilled and my wait hasn’t finished yet.

I expect that you will immediately look into this matter and try to amicably resolve this. Either your company should return the set repaired or if it is not possible due to any critical problem I am eligible for new set as per terms and condition of warranty.
I hope to have an urgent action.

Yours faithfully,
Mubashir Noorani
