## Model Answer 1:

Dear Sir / Madam,

My name is Rona Lyn Olivar. I am currently working as an ICU Nurse (Intensive Care Unit) in a tertiary level and private hospital called the Urdaneta City Sacred Heart Hospital which is situated in the province of Pangasinan here in the Philippines. I have learned in our ICU Department that your expert team will be conducted an EKG (Electrocardiogram) thorough training in Singapore. I am writing to you today because I would also like to attend and ask about specific information regarding the seminar schedules, about the program, accommodation and the cost.

Firstly, with regards to dates and time, I would like to ask when will be the seminar held. How many days will it take and how many hours in a day will we have to engage. What time would the training be started and ended?

Secondly, I would also want to know what would be the topic outline of the program, the things we are required to bring something in and what would be the benefits for us Registered nurses who will be attending the seminar.

And finally, I would also like to know about the accommodation and the cost. Since I am living here in the Philippines, and Singapore is about 3 1/2 hours from my country and I have no any relatives or friends in that country. Will you be helping us to settle our staying place or do we need to have a booking in a hotel? And also because it is my first time to travel abroad, I do not know how much will I be needing to spend with it.

I am looking forward to hearing from you soon regarding my concerns.

Yours faithfully,
R.Olivar

## Model Answer 2:

Dear Sir/Madam,

I am writing to request information regarding the conference that is being arranged by your organisation in the next month, advertised in the local newspaper. I was wondering if I could acquire detailed information about the program beforehand then it would be worthwhile to plan the trip appropriately.

Mainly, I'd like to receive details about below points:

• I heard the symposium is three days long but exact dates are expected to sanction the leaves from work.
• Expected a basic level of course knowledge before actually attending the conclave.
• Venue details with navigational maps, if possible.
• Sitting arrangements available, auditorium or a hotel boutique, for instance, with sitting capacity.
• If a laptop and other stationary items are required or not.
• Accommodation type half board or full board.
• The total price of the entire program with early bird discount if bookings are done well in advance for three persons.

I'm hoping to receive this information for above points no later than one week before the scheduled starting date of the seminar. You could send the information via Fax or can send an email on sheldon.cooper@tbt.com. Your help and time will be greatly appreciated.

Thank you in advance. Looking forward to hearing from you soon.

Sincerely yours,
Dev.

Dear Sir / Madam,

I am keen to receive information about the Enterprise Architecture Seminar scheduled to happen next month.

This is Raj Muthuraman, working as a Senior Architect in BT Financial Group, presenting a paper on ‘Failure more and recovery of technical orchestration’ in the seminar. I am excited to present my research paper at the seminar. The invitation I received for the event did not confirm the dates as they were still being finalised. Can you confirm the dates of the event and provide an agenda for the event so that I can plan ahead. Also, can you suggest some good hotels in the area with an indicative cost that will help me in planning my travel, accommodation and financial aspects of the trip?

It would be great if you can send me the requested details at the earliest date preferably by the end of this week by fax or mail.

Looking forward to hearing from you.

Yours Faithfully,
Raj Muthuraman

Dear Sir,

With due respect, I would like to participate in the seminar which is going to be organised by your well-reputed company.

As I am residing in Bangladesh which is in another continent, I would like to know detailed information regarding the dates and program schedule so that I can prepare myself according to the schedule because there are various facts connected to the schedule like arranging visa and buying ticket according to the schedule for travelling to your country.

In addition to that, I would also request you to provide details about accommodation during the program whether the arrangement to be made by the host or I need to arrange of my own. I would also like to know about the total cost of attending the seminar and other expenditure like accommodation, meals, fares etc.

Yours faithfully,

## Model Answer 6:

Dear Sir/Madam,

I am writing this letter in connection with the upcoming seminar on “Automation testing - Tips for beginners” to be held in Toronto, Canada in June 2016.

I am currently employed as a Software manual tester and I have been performing this role for the last 5 years. I have always had a keen interest in learning testing automation tools and use automated testing in addition to manual testing to increase my scope of testing. By getting myself acquainted to automation testing, I can accomplish my daily tasks comparatively faster. I learnt about the Automation testing workshop while it was broadcasted on local radio station.

As the advertisement was being announced, I was driving and was unable to catch most of the information like the date and venue details as well as the accommodation and cost. I will be highly obliged if you can write back to me the program schedule of the symposium along with the dates and venue details. Also, I would like to be informed about how the visa and accommodation arrangements will be done.

Awaiting your quick response.

Thanking you in anticipation.
Larissa.

## Model Answer 7:

Dear Sir/ Madam,

I am very excited about the upcoming seminar on "Risk management in Financial Industry" that will be organised by you. However, I am a bit worried because the information I received does not have the dates, program, accommodation plan and the cost.

I currently work in a financial institution and have spent over 5 years in the Risk Management sector, thus the seminar will be of immense benefit to me in facing current risk management issues.

Firstly, please provide me with the actual date the seminar will commence and the duration of it. Also, I will want to know the schedule of the seminar and the exact timing of it on each day. Secondly, please provide me with the program structure, whether it will take the form of a paper presentation or not. Also, inform me the type of materials I will need to participate in it. Lastly, in the area of accommodation, will you handle the booking for International participants and what will the cost be.

Thank you in advance. Looking forward to hearing from you.

Yours faithfully,
Cyril Chinkata
