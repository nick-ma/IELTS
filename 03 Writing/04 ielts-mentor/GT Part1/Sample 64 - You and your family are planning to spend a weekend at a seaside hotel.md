## Sample Answer 2:

Dear Sir,

I am writing this letter to inform you that we are planning to spend a weekend in your hotel and I would like to request you to make some necessary arrangements for us.

We will be arriving on Thursday, 22nd March around 3: 00 pm. We will spend the weekend and will check-out from the hotel on Saturday afternoon. It is requested to arrange two rooms as per the mentioned dates. Please make sure that both the rooms should be adjacent and must have a door in between, so we can trespass the rooms. One of the two rooms must have a balcony. One view of both the rooms should be of seaside. Kindly let me know the cost of spending the weekend in your hotel. Also advise if you have any weekend package for the families.

We will be visiting the place for the first time, so I would appreciate if you could share the places which are worth visiting.

Thank You.
Yours faithfully,

"M"
