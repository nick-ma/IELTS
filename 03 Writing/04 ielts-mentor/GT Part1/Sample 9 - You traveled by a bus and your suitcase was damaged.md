## Model Answer 1:

Dear sir/madam,

I am writing to complain about the damages that have happened to my suitcase while travelling from Edmonton to Calgary last week on April 5 using bus service of your company ‘Mapple Tree Transportation'.

Usually, I prefer to carry luggage bags made of fibre or other hard materials, but unfortunately, this time, I picked suitcase made of soft fabric. It is a make of American Tourister, blue in colour. It's rectangular shaped suitcase with wheels and telescoping handles having a top handle of black colour. The bottom part of the suitcase was torn down while forcefully pulling it from luggage box of the bus by your staff. What' more, to my surprise, left side wheel of my suitcase was also broken into the pieces due to excessive luggage pushed into small luggage box of the bus by the staff.

Mishandling of passenger's luggage is truly a mistake of your staff. Damage to my suitcase happened due to inadequate management and carelessness by your staff; therefore, I request quick action in this regard and ask for full payment for the damage caused to suitcase as the suitcase is useless for me. Awaiting prompt reply from you.

Thank you in advance.

Sincerely yours,
Andy

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to require a compensation for the property damage, taken place at the time of the travelling by the bus of your company.

I travelled from Washington, D.C. to Boston by the bus #301 on February 21, 2007. Before the trip, I passed my luggage to the driver, who helped me to place my suitcase in the luggage compartment of the bus. After the arrival, the driver opened this back compartment and the first thing I saw was that my new and brand-name suitcase was smashed under the pressure of the weight of the other’s luggage.

My suitcase was quite firm and very beautiful in its red colour and modern design. However, it obviously hasn’t been designed to resist such a weight on it. I am very depressed because I can not use anymore my broken suitcase, its handle was bent and two wheels out of 4 were detached.

Since damage stated above was caused by the careless actions of your employee, I would like to require a compensation of $200, which was the original price of my suitcase. Please, deliver a cheque to the address, written above.

Faithfully yours,
Ethan Deen

## Model Answer 3:

Dear Sir,

I'm one of the passengers who travelled from London to Manchester on 20 September and I'm writing to complain about your service as I got my suitcase damaged during the journey.

We left London at around 2:00 pm and I took my suitcase to the bus driver before moving. It was a red hue and four-wheel suitcase and I put my necessary things in it. When we arrived at the Manchester's terminal, I received my suitcase and I noticed that all of its wheels were broken. I expressed the situation to the bus driver but he didn't take any action for the problem.

Last day, I brought my suitcase to the city centre and I found that I can't repair it and so, I should purchase another one. As your company is responsible for this issue, I would ask you to pay me for another same suitcase. I have attached a file which describes all of the details about my suitcase and also you can see how it damaged by  looking at the attached pictures.

I look forward to hearing from you in the near future.

Yours Sincerely
Milad Rahimi

## Model Answer 4:

Dear Sir/Madam,

I am writing to bring to your attention an issue that I faced while travelling by your bus from Hamburg to Frankfurt on 25th June 2015. Allow me to elaborate.

As you know, this was supposed to be a long and tedious journey hence like most travellers, I submitted my baggage to be kept in a separate compartment. When the bus reached its Frankfurt terminal, I was shocked to discover that one of my suitcases was severely damaged. It was a maroon suitcase that my dad had given to me as a present on my graduation and hence had a lot of sentimental value attached to it in addition to being a very costly item.

Since I had taken out travel insurance with your company before embarking on this journey, I expect you to reimburse me the amount equivalent to the fair value of my suitcase. Please find the enclosed insurance claim form along with receipt of the suitcase. I have already decided that if you fail to pay me consideration for my loss, I shall institute legal proceedings against your company in small claims court.

I am anticipating immediate remedial action.

Kind Regards,
Sam
