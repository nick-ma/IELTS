## Model Answer:

Dear Sir/Madam,

I wanted to let you know that I am coming to live in (...the city name...) and I would like to ask if you can help me with a few things before I arrive and start my new job.

Do you think you could give me a hand finding somewhere to live? Ideally, I would like to live close to where I am going to be working, or in the downtown district. If possible I would like to be near some shops, much like a supermarket and a DVD rental place. As I really love sports it would be great to be near a park too.

I’m not too worried about the place itself. Obviously, I will be looking for a flat, rather than a house, as it is just going to be me and I won’t be able to afford too much. So, a place with one bedroom is fine, but I would like to have a private bathroom (not shared), a kitchen and some kind of living room. It doesn’t matter if the kitchen is small, but it would nice to have one. I would prefer to live somewhere new, so anything in a modern apartment block would be great.

Thanks for your help.

Sincerely Yours,

## Alternative Answer:

Dear Mr. Y,

Hope you are in the best of health.

As I informed you earlier via email that I will be moving to Saudi Arab for a new job that I got in a Private company. I have arrived yesterday in Riyadh city and will be requiring for help and support to find a suitable accommodation as I have to join the company next week.

I would like to find an accommodation at some distance from my office location which is situated in the city centre as I don’t like to live in a populated area. The location if possible should have a park so that I can spend my free time jogging around.

I would like to live in an apartment or flat because it will be a bit cheaper than a bungalow which currently I won’t be able to afford. In the building, there should have the parking facility as I will be buying a car next month. Finally, I would like the building to have an indoor sports club to play sports during weekends.

I am sure you will help me out to find a good accommodation so that I can settle down quickly.

Best Regards,
…………........
