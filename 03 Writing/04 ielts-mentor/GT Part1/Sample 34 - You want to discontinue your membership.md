## Model Answer 1:  

Dear Sir,

In September 2006, I joined your Sports and Social club as a full-time student member. Since then I have paid the monthly membership fees by direct debit from my bank: Nationwide in Sanderson Avenue, Kingshill.

I have thoroughly enjoyed my club membership as it has provided me with useful opportunities to meet up with other young people and to participate in a number of social activities. I have also been fortunate enough to play in some of the inter-club tennis tournaments and have taken advantage of the various classes available such as Yoga and T'ai chi.

However, my studies are now coming to an end and as I will shortly be returning to my home country, possibly for good, I regret that I no longer wish to continue my membership.

I would be grateful, therefore, if you could confirm in writing that the monthly fee will no longer be deducted from my bank account.

Sincerely yours,

Alister Book.

Dear Sir/Madam,

To introduce myself, I am a full-time Gold member of your reputed club â€“ "Fitness Shield". My membership started 1 year back on 5th May 2015 & it is valid 2 more years. All the dues were paid by me in advance, including the security deposit.

Not to mention, your well-equipped club has provided me enormous benefits in last 1 year. The wide range of sports & fitness, activities & equipment is really a plus over the large area you have for the club. The Gym has helped me, to regain my lean body shape again, using Gym is the right choice for me, being without any partner/friend here. Also, the outdoor activities are phenomenal here & the Lawn tennis coach, mentor me a lot to learn the basics of the game.

Hard to say, still I am bound to cancel my membership here from 30th May 2015. The reason is, I am being transferred to another city from my organisation. I have no choice left except cancellation. Kindly refund my security deposit & any fee amount left after all deductions to my bank account number 1123456 (Barclays bank, Oxford Street, London).

Thanks for making me a member of your club.

Your Truly
Rahul Choudhary

Dear Club Secretary,

This is to bring to your kind attention that I am the member of your Gold club located in West Coast District. I joined the club in 5th August 2014 and bought the yearly membership. I have been quite regular and have made many friends here in the club. I have not only provided my feedbacks on areas where the club needs improvement but also helped the marketing team with innovative ideas using my marketing experience. This has helped the club to raise $1000 funds during the promotional Class and also helped people bring in friends or family members.

Apart from this, I have also benefitted the club by sharing my encouragement and inspiration with all of the colleagues on health benefits of exercising daily and promoting the schemes your club has to offer if they join immediately. Based on my speech 7 of my friends have already subscribed and 3 of them planned to join by next Monday.

I would like also like to inform you that unfortunately, I would not be able to continue my membership after May 2015 as I will be relocating to Canada because of the Job opportunity I have been waiting for the last couple of years. Requesting you to kindly cancel my membership. I would be highly grateful if you could refund the money for the months I will not be using the club facility. I would surely miss the club and its services and especially the friends I made here.

Best Regards,
Gaurav.

Dear Sir,

I would like to express my gratitude to the local yoga club which you designate as a secretary. It would give me immense pleasure in highlighting the benefits I had received by being a lifetime member for a year.

Not to mention, the day when I first enrolled into your club as an amateur with no knowledge of Yoga. I would like to recall that I paid an amount of Rs 2000 in person at the club front desk, at that moment when I was paying, I was received cordially and promised that I would benefit immensely out of the membership. As promised, I was fully apprised of the yoga and its benefits, apart from learning yoga and becoming an expert in the yoga practice, I am maintaining a good health by practising and also not to forget the change in my attitude and personality developed due to the benefits as a member.

With pain, I would like to inform you that my assignment is completed in this area and would be transferred to another location. I request you to cancel my membership or transfer the membership where I would be relocating or keep it under abeyance.

I would certainly be a part of your club, if it is located in my new workplace and also if my job permits, I would be continuing the membership if I am reposted with a new assignment in this area.

Once again I thank the club and the congenial relationship all the members maintained with me.

Thank you for your kind cooperation.

Prasadarao.
