## Model Answer 1:  

Dear Sir/Madam,

I am writing this letter in reply to a letter that I received from your bank a few days ago. In your letter, you indicate that $240 is overdrawn from my account that is why I will be charged by $70. However, I think this mistake is done by your employee or computing system.

As you know, I was staying in a rented house, and my freight goes directly to the house owner account from my account. Last month, I had changed my house; moreover, I wrote a letter to you for requesting not to vest the money anymore to the owner. I have got the acknowledgement from you of my application; but, nothing is done about this matter. Perhaps, this money is overdrawn from my account because one of your employees wrongly sends the money to my former owner.

However, I will request my earlier house owner so that he returns the money. I expect you will give immediate attention to this matter. I look forward to receiving your response.

Yours faithfully,
John

Dear Sir/Madam,

I am writing in reply to a letter I received from you a few days ago. In your letter, you state that I am $240 overdrawn and that you will be charging me $70.

I would like to point out that the reason I am overdrawn is because of a mistake made by your bank. If you look through your records you will see that I wrote several weeks ago explaining the situation. For the last twelve months, I have been paying $300 a month for a car I bought last summer. The monthly payments were taken directly from my bank account. However, two months ago I sold the car and I wrote to you instructing you to stop paying the monthly installments. I received a letter from you acknowledging my request, but, for some reason, nothing was done about it. Another $300 installment has been paid this month and this is the reason why I am overdrawn.

I would like you to contact the garage where I bought the car explaining your error. I would also like you to ask them to return the money.

Yours faithfully,
Sandra Roll

Dear Sir,

I am writing in response to the letter (Ref : ABZ ) received from the Bank, dated 20th March 2015, on charging a penalty amount of $70 from my account, in lieu of an overdrawn sum of $240 made on 15th March 2015.Please note that the over debit has been made unintentional, thus allow me to explain you the situation clearly.

On 15th March 2015, a purchase of $480 from the supermarket ABZ Limited was made by me. During the payment, the shopkeeper swiped the debit card twice accidentally and double amount got withdrawn from my account. The shopkeeper, on realising his mistake, has reversed the transaction and confirmed that the reversal would be done successfully in 10 days. However, according to the letter received from PYZ payment Limited company citing software up-gradation reason, the reversal will take another 10 days to process.  

Therefore, considering my circumstances, I would request you to not charge the penalty amount of $70 for the overdrawn total of $240.

Looking forward to hearing from you.

Yours faithfully,
Ria

Dear Sir,
To: Accounting Department

Dear Sir or Madam
I am writing this to notify you that I recently received a letter from this bank stating that my account is $240 overdrawn and that I will be charged $70 which will be taken directly from my account which I insist is not a correct information.

The last time I withdrew money from my account was three weeks ago and after that time I have visited the bank once to save some amount of money into the same account. Knowing that I have received an incorrect information, I request that you take an appropriate action so that the problem might be sorted out and corrected in due time. I hereby present a copy of my bank book and receipts for further information and proof.

Sincerely yours,

## Model Answer 6:  

Dear Sir,

I am writing this letter to notify you about the mistake that had recently been made in my account transactions. What you stated in your recent letter was wrong! Perhaps that had been done by one of your employees. Your letter stated that there is an overdrawn of $240 and that is why I will be charged the penalty of $70. I really am very worried about this because there is no way I have made any overdrawn from my bank account. A few days ago, I visited your bank to deposit $500. I withdrew $240 a week after my deposit. There is a possibility that my $500 deposit was not correctly entered in your accounting tally book.

So, I kindly request you to correct this error of penalty of $70 as well as correct my previous deposit amount. Such error in customer account would make customers unhappy because it will directly affect customer's financial position. Therefore I also suggest you to assure me that such errors would be scrutinised before sending a letter to a customer. I am also attaching my deposit slip of $500 with this letter.

Thank you

With Regards
Sudip Pant
