## Model Answer 1:

Dear Sir / Madam,

I am writing in regard to cancel my membership at Superb Club.

I first enrolled as a member a year ago. Since then, my membership has been upgraded to Silver Associate with a monthly fee of $50, paid every first Monday of the month. This club has given me numerous benefits by providing many activities, such as yoga classes that I am really fond of, as well as access to gym and swimming pool. Not to mention that there are always generous discounts on the food in the buffet restaurant.

Sadly, given my circumstances, I would have to discontinue my membership at this club. The reason is because I will soon be moving to another city. Thus, I would no longer be able to attend any activities held in this place. If I am not mistaken, my $200 deposit will be returned to me upon membership cancellation. Please advise should there be any particular form that you need me to fill in.

Thank you. I look forward to hearing from you.

Yours faithfully,

Helen.

## Model Answer 2:

Dear Mr. Secretary,

I am writing this letter to inform about my discontinuance on Classic membership card from next month onwards. I am Andrew Scott living 2 blocks away from the club. I have been a member of this club (MS/no: 003/2011) since the start of it and as you are aware that for early members, the payment was done through online transactions. Attached documents show my past years' transactions to the club.

This club was indeed a blessing in disguise when our locality never had any recreational facilities and just had a jogging track without any proper markings. But with the emergence of this prestigious club, I personally benefitted enormously - I made some good friends, learned rules of various games, managing skills and last but not least, administrative working styles of the club which is also associated with my present career.

With a heavy heart and immense regret, I am discontinuing my bond with this club due to my recent transfer to the USA. I have no words to fill my sorrow over this decision, but I feel this is the just the softest way to communicate my decision.

Sincerely Yours,
Andrew Scott

## Model Answer 3:

Dear Mr Brooke,

I regret to inform you that I have to discontinue my membership at your Golden Hook Fishing Club.

I joined the Club 1 year ago and the benefits from the participation exceeded the fee. The round tables and lectures of famous fishermen were absolutely brilliant. Moreover, discounts on the equipment in sports gear shops helped me to save money. The last but not the least, your monthly illustrated magazine was a precious treat to me.

Unfortunately, I have to move to another country because my father who is living in France, is in a desperate health condition. I must acknowledge that continuing the membership in your Club is no longer an option to me.

I have paid the last year fee by my credit card and its details are in your database. Because of above-stated reasons, I would like to ask you not to charge me for the following year. I hope that in the future I will have an opportunity to recommence having advantages of participation in your Club.

Sincerely yours,
John Philip.

Dear Mr Mahin,

My name is Milad Rahimi and I have been one of your club memberships for the last 2 year. I’m writing to inform you that unfortunately, I can’t continue my membership in your club because of illness.

I enrolled in your club gym on 20th September and I have been allowed to do exercise in your club three days per week. I have paid all of the membership costs by charging my Visa Card monthly and I am really satisfied by your service as it provides me modern exercise machines and has a very nice environment.

Unfortunately last week, towards the end of my work, I slipped and fell on the wet floor and broke my foot. It is my right foot and however it doesn’t need surgery, I can’t do exercise until the plaster can be taken off. My doctor has told me that I should wait for about four months and perhaps I return to your club after the time being. So, please cancel my membership account and thanks again for your good service.

I look forward to hearing from you in the near future.

Yours faithfully

Milad Rahimi

Dear sir/ madam,

I am writing in regard to cancellation of my membership at Philippine Society of Mechanical Engineers.

I have been a member of this club since 2002. Since then I have received numerous favour from this organisation. I have learned a bunch of things through seminars conducted by the society. I have also meet professionals within our group and I have received career advice from them.

A year ago I applied for residency in Australia and last week I received the approved decision. Under this circumstance, I have to cancel my membership. I understand that our club is not recognised in that country, for this reason, I can no longer use my membership in the club.

I might seek for accreditation to any group from that country, and they might ask for a referee. I would like to ask your permissions to make as my character reference.

Thank you in advance, my best wishes for the society, I wishing for more success to its members and future members.
 
 
Respectfully Yours,

Joel Calderon
