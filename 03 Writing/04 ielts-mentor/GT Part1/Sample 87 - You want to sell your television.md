## Sample Answer 1:

Dear Rob,

Hope you are doing well. I would like to share an exciting news with you that I got a job offer in New York and I am planning to leave next month. I am also writing this to let you know that I am not shipping my furniture to my destination; instead, I want to sell them off. This is because the freight charges are more than the value of the assets.
Actually, I want to emphasise a specific product which is ultra slim LED television, which you may be interested in. I bought it 6 months ago and it is under company’s warranty for 6 more months. The brand of the TV is SAMSUNG. It is 32 inches wide. It is a smart TV, with this feature you can access the internet on the TV itself. The exceptional feature of this TV is 3-Dimensional view (3D). I have a pair of 3D glasses as well.

I believe this sounded very interesting to you, however, I advise you to have a clear demonstration of the functional and operational procedures. I am happy to invite you for this on the next weekend, specifically on Saturday, 28th of March. We can also negotiate on the price at the same time.

Kindly reply me with your thoughts on buying this television. Hope to hear from you soon.

Yours’ Lovingly,
Ramesh.

## Sample Answer 2:

Dear Alfred,

I hope this letter finds you in good spirits. I am writing regarding a television set that I want to offer you to purchase.

I am jubilant to tell you that I have been accepted into the University of Berkshire for the Master’s in Business program, and will be leaving for the UK next month. Since I will be living in the UK for the next 3 years, I am hoping to sell all my belongings that I will not be able to take with me. My one such possession is a TV set. It is a 40 inch ‘Samsung Smart TV’ with built in Android operating system, and it is equipped with Wi-Fi and many other rich features such as 3D view and the surround sound. I am willing to sell it to you at a cheap price as a token of my gratitude for your loyal friendship.

As I will be departing from Lahore on 10th July, I hope you can drop by on 8th July and see the TV to figure out whether you want to buy it or not.

Hoping to see you soon,

Yours,
Sam
