## Model Answer 1:

Dear Tom,

I hope this letter will find you well. I am so glad to hear that you are going to pay a visit to Guangzhou on this Sunday. I can't wait to meet you right now.

However, I have received an urgent call from my boss that I will have to join a meeting with my customers on Sunday at 10.00 am. So I am afraid I can't catch up with you at the airport at 10.30 am as the meeting is estimated lasting for more than one hour. I will get to the airport as soon as I finish my meeting so please wait for me for a while. During that time you may collect your baggage and grab some coffee. I will probably show up around one hour later, at around 11.30 am.

If you see a guy wearing the white T-shirt and black trousers, that is me. Check my photo on my Facebook again to ensure you can recognise me at a glance. I will call you in case you can't find me when I get to there.
 
Regards.
Johnny.

Dear Nancy,

I am very much looking forward to your visit to my city. Just think: after all these years to writing to each other, we will finally have the chance to meet! However, I regret to inform you that I will not be able to meet you at the airport as soon as you arrive.

The reason is that your flight will arrive early in the morning, and the quickest time I can get to the airport will be about an hour after you land. Please wait for me in the arrival lounge. You should be able to have breakfast there while you wait.

By the way, as we have never met I must tell you how to recognise me: I am of medium height and have a small moustache. In addition, I will be carrying a copy of the morning newspaper tucked under my left arm.

Looking forward to our first meeting.

Yours sincerely,
Thomas Brook

Dear John,

I am doing well here. I hope the same from you.

It was great to hear that you are arriving here on next week. It will be a great pleasure to meet my pen pal after 2 years of our friendship.  I am doing some preparations for your welcome, but it is sad to inform you that, I cannot make it happen on time due to my meeting with my boss at the same time. I asked my boss for leave, but due to short deadlines of our current project, I could not get it.  I will be there in one hour after your arrival. It would be great if you could wait for me till then. There are a small cafeteria and a small magazine shop where you can spend some idle time.

I would prefer to wear both of us yellow colour T-shirt with blue jeans on the day of our meeting for our identification, as we both like that colour. I hope this would be fine for you. I will be waiting for you.

Yours,
Ram

## Model Answer 4:

Dear John,

I am glad to know you are visiting my city this Monday. I am writing this letter to inform you that I will not be able to receive you at the airport on time.

I feel sorry for the inconvenience. I have a compulsory meeting to attend on the same day. Actually, the meeting was scheduled on Wednesday, two days after your arrival. Unfortunately, it is preponed, because my business delegates want a presentation earlier due to some reasons. However, you have to wait for me until I reach there. Mostly, I may be late for an hour.

How about wearing a black suit so that we can easily identify each other? Moreover, I will be holding a sign post showing “Welcome John”. You also bring that bag which I sent you on friendship day. Both of us would bring the printed copy of this letter. On the other hand, I will Email you my address as well as contact numbers for your further help.

I look forward to meeting you as early as possible.

Best wishes,
Vishwa.

## Model Answer 5:

Dear Tina,

Hi! Hope you are fine along with your family. It was a pleasant surprise to receive your letter, and knowing about your plan to drop down in Delhi, albeit for a couple of hours. I have already started feeling elated by knowing the fact that you are actually visiting the city I live in. I’m so excited that I can’t wait any longer to meet you, in person.

However, I learnt from your letter that you would probably land in Delhi for a transit halt of about two hours, at around 1700 hours. The cause of concern is that, due to a distance of more than 30 kilometres from my office to the airport, I’ll not be able to catch up with you on time. It takes around one hour to reach the airport due to heavy evening traffic. I will be leaving my office at 1715 hours. I’ll not leave any stone unturned to meet you. Even in the worst scenario, I’ll be able to reach the airport by 1815 hours. You may please wait for me at the airport lounge until 1835 hours.

For your information, I’ll be wearing the red jacket with blue stripes on back and the alphabet ‘X’ inscribed on the front in fluorescent green colour. It is the same jacket which you gifted me on my twenty-fifth birthday.

Eagerly waiting to see you soon.

Yours,
Mira

## Model Answer 6:

Dear John,

I hope you are doing well. I have no words to express my happiness as finally I can put a face on your words and we can get together.

Honestly, I have been up to my eyes during the last two nights and unbelievably I pulled an all-nighter last night to go through the whole material and could get a pass mark in Geography. Actually, I am supposed to stay in the campus until 6:00 to turn in an extracurricular project to compensate for the probable lack of passing scores.

In this case, I will be presumably late to pick you up at the airport. I would be grateful if you could wait for a couple of hours and let me drive you to a hotel.

I will be wearing down to a pair of baggy jeans suited with my white sneakers and a red V-neck shirt and I will be staying by the lost and found office to meet you.

With best regards

Farshad

## Model Answer 7:

Dear X,
I’m glad that you are going to visit my city. I’m very keen to see you for the first time. I’ve made an image of you by considering your writings. It’s a good decision to come round. My city has several see sights which could be a wonderful experience for you. I’m sure you will have nice times here.

That’s my pleasure to welcome you in the airport. But unfortunately, I can’t be in the airport on your arrival at 15:50 because of my working time constraints. I haven’t any leave at that time. I hope you understand my situation. I will exit my work just 10 minutes after your entrance. So, I will pick you up at around 16:20. I will carry a white board and your name will be written on it.

I apologise about the situation and eagerly look forward to seeing you.

Yours sincerely,
Ali
