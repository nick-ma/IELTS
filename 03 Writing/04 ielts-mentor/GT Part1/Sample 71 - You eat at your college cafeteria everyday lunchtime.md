## Sample Answer:

Dear Margaret,
I have decided to write this letter to inform you with a few personal ideas I have about our college cafeteria.

It is personally felt that our college cafeteria offers exceptionally good foods, which always taste incredibly amazing. I appreciate the hard work of all the chefs and their attempt to feed the students who can sometimes be picky.

However, not only myself, but it seems that many of the students do not feel pleased about how expensive most of the foods are. All restaurants charge at least $15 for each lunch menu and this is considered a very high price compared to the restaurants outside the college.

It appears that students will soon make an inevitable choice to eat outside the campus due to their poor financial situation. As an individual who would love to continue eating fantastic food at our central eatery, I would like to suggest you to publish an article about this issue. I hope this will help the college restaurant owners become aware of how we think of their food price.

If you have any further questions about this, please let me know.

Yours faithfully,
Kay
