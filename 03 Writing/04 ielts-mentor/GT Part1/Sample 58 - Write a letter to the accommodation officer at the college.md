# You are going on a short training course at a collage in Greenmount, Northern Ireland. You need somewhere to live while you are there.

You should write at least 150 words.

## Model Answer 1:

Dear Sir,

I am Alex Jones, an aspirant of the forthcoming training course on "Time Management", at your college. I am writing to enquire about the accommodation facilities available for the course seekers.

I am currently employed in the city of Boston, as a Chartered Accountant to a reputed firm. This discourse on time management (as detailed in your college website), and as I reckon, would serve the best in purpose for me. My only concern is about the accommodation amenities arranged from your end. The very intention of this letter is that, I would like to take the privilege of describing about my priorities on accommodation arranged.

First of all, it would be highly appreciated if I am rendered with a single home or flat, as I have had enough problems, prior with sharing my personnel space. Secondly, I would like to dwell in a calm and quiet environment, as tranquility of the work place is of at most importance for me. Lastly, I would be glad to stay close to the course venue, so as to ensure optimum management of time.

Last but not least, I plan to arrive on 19th of this month at your venue via road.  I would be more than happy, to get myself comfortable with the new amenities, a day before the course actually commence. I really look forward to spend some quality time at your place.

In anticipation

Jones

## Sample Answer 2:

Dear Sir/Madam,

I am Namrata, an MBA final year student of your collage, and my roll number is T2421. I am writing this letter for accommodation help. My summer training has been confirmed in Greenmount, Northern Ireland, and I am looking for an accommodation as I do not know anyone there. That place is completely new for me, so I am seeking your help.
 
I am searching for an accommodation of a room with shared two beds, with small kitchen area and attached bathroom. It would be fine if someone is interested to share the room but preferably she has to be female and is either working or may be an intern.  I would prefer someone around 20 years old.
 
My training is going to start on 1st day of January next year and I shall reach there on 30th November of this year. I need confirmation of my stay before the training starts. Therefore please help me arranging my stay in Greenmount as soon as possible. Looking forward to hearing from you soon0.
 
 
Sincerely Yours
Namrata

## Sample Answer 3:

Dear Sir,

I  Ms Zona, studying in Vision Leaf College in Sri Lanka for last one year. I got an opportunity to participate in the short training course on report writing at Greenmount College in Nothern Ireland. This will be one week residential course.

Since I am new to the country, I do not have any friends or any contact person to request for an accommodation. This was an opportunity received by one of my friends and since she is sick I got this opportunity suddenly. I received this message in very short time period. Also I have only another one week time to prepare for this course and find accommodation before that. I seek your kind support to arrange an accommodation for this purpose.

Since I am a student and not attached to any employment, I search a place which is cheaper as possible. I would prefer to have a single room with common bathroom and latrine. If not possible to find that kind of an accommodation, I would prefer to have at least a shared room with any other college students.

The course will be start on 28th of February 2015. I need to attend to the place at least on 27th Evening. I would be thanking, if you could find a place to be stay on 27th Evening to 8th March 2015. Kindly contact me at any time through any of the following contact modes.   

Thank you

Sincerely,
Ms K Zona.
