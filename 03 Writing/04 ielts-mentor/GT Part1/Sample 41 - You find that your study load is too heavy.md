# You find that your study load is too heavy. Write a letter to your college teacher explaining why you need to withdraw from two courses. Ask if it is possible to obtain a refund.

You should write at least 150 words.


 
## Model Answer:

Dear Prof. Jandriya,

I am writing to formally request to withdraw from two courses: Introduction to Elementary Education (EDU602) and Teaching Methods (EDU 619)

The main reason for reducing my course load is that I am finding it extremely difficult to manage six courses. In the beginning of the term, I was perhaps overly optimistic about juggling both my full-time studies and my part-time job (20 hours/week). Because I really must work part time, I have no other choice but to decrease my course load. I am planning on taking the two courses during the summer semester if they are available. Thus I will be able to complete all the courses for the degree program by the following year.

I would also like to request a tuition refund, and hope I am not too late to receive the full reimbursement. I am sorry for any inconveniences I have caused by this change in plans. This decision was not taken lightly, and I do appreciate the kind consideration you have shown to me.

Thank you for your attention to these requests. If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me at 277-9144. I look forward to hearing from you soon.

Sincerely yours,

Alex Dalton.
