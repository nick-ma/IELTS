## Model Answer 1:

Dear Sir,

I have just returned home after spending three nights at your hotel in Paddington. The staff were very friendly and the location was extremely convenient. However, I feel I must express my disappointment about the room.

As we all know, London is experiencing a very warm summer this year, with temperatures around 30 °C last week, which is quite unusual. As a result, it was very hot in my room on the sixth floor.

Because of the extreme heat in the room, I had to leave the windows open all night and so it was very noisy, as the hotel is on the main road and the traffic never stops in London. Consequently, I got very little sleep over the three nights.

I think it would be a good idea to install an air-conditioning system in the hotel. This could also be used as a heating system in the winter and would certainly make the rooms more comfortable. Perhaps you would consider giving me a discount if I come to your hotel again.

I look forward to hearing from you.

Yours faithfully

Walker Luise.

 

## Model Answer 2:

To,
The manager, Ibis Hotel.

Dear Sir,
I had recently stayed in Ibis Hotel, Heidelberg for about a week. Contrary to the usual, the temperatures were high on that day and unfortunately for me, the Air Conditioner of my room was not fully operational. I am writing this letter to complain about the same.

I checked in to the hotel at midnight and straightaway went to bed. However, a few minutes later after turning the Air Conditioner on, I realised that the room was not getting cooler and there was a problem with the Air Conditioner. Subsequently, I called the hotel staff to check on the problem but they were not able to fix it. Moreover, there was no other vacant room available. As a solution, I had to open the windows and rely on natural air to cool my room. I had to sleep in skimpy clothes, which I don’t prefer, to overcome the heat.

Therefore, I want you to refund 50% of my hotel charges or provide me with a free stay in a deluxe room, the next time I check in to your hotel.

Yours Truly,
John.
