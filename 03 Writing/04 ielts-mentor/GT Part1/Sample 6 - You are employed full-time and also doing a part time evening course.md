Dear Sir,

This is to inform you that I will not be able to participate in the course program any more due to a foreign official tour.

For your kind information that I am working in Risk Management Division of Prime Bank Limited that has a subsidiary company in Hong Kong where an incident has been reported by the governing authority of the country for which I have to travel there for analyzing the whole situation, scrutiny the allegations against the company and take appropriate measures if necessary. As the whole process will take about two months or more depending on the situation I will not be able to take the final exam of the course also.
 
Under this circumstance, I am requesting you to transfer the course for the next semester and allow me to take the course without any further registration for the same course. Your cooperation in this regard will be highly appreciated.
 
Yours faithfully,

Safayet Ullah

Dear Dr. Jones,

I am writing to inform you that I no longer have a possibility to attend your evening lectures on treating emergencies.

As I told you earlier, I received a position of a nurse at the Thompson Hospital. My shift ends at 5 pm and since I have got a lot of overtime job recently, I found myself unable to be on time at your lectures, which start at 5.30 pm. This disappoints me a lot since I value and respect your course and your experience.

I would be grateful if you could consider letting me study your course myself. Because of my job is closely related to the accidents treatment, I feel able to learn every point of the course in practice. In addition, I have already read almost every book you recommended as the supplementary reading for your lectures.

I hope to get your approval on this matter soon. I am looking forward to receiving your response.

Sincerely yours,
Nadia Afsana

## Model Answer 3:

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am Siamak Mirzaei and I registered for the Social Marketing course in Cambridge institute of Technology last July. I am writing this letter to inform you that I cannot attend this course for I have faced some unexpected issues.

The Social Marketing course started last July 2014 and it was planned to be finished by February this year but because of the numerous number of the public holidays in 2014, it will be finished by May 2015. This class was on every odd day in the evening from 7 to 9 so that employees like me can attend the class after the working hours. Unfortunately, I cannot continue this course as I am not free in the mentioned times since I should take care of my 4-year-old child in the evenings from the first week of March. I am a married man and my wife works in the evenings of the same days on weekdays. She kindly asked her boss to change her roster for the expected time, but she has to work in the evenings from the first week of March.

I talked to Mr. Lee who is the topic coordinator on 10th of February and he kindly recommended the online course to me. Therefore, I am going the watch the recorded lectures and attend the final exam at the end of this course. He asked me to inform you about this matter and get your confirmation.

Thanks in advance for your cooperation.

I am looking forward to hearing from you soon.

Yours faithfully,

Siamak Mirzaei

## Model Answer 4:

Dear Dr. Smith,

I would like to inform you that I am unable to continue your evening lectures about computer graphics due to my official long tour. This course is enormously important and relevant to my profession, as I am a  branding supervisor  in Premier  Bank limited.

The bank is going to open two new branches in Chittagong which is far from this city and I have to stay there likely 3 to 4 months, to manage the branding and advertising activities.

In that case, I am afraid of decreasing the graphics skill level which I have learned in past two months with your brilliant teaching method. Hence, it is a humble request to you, if you could grant me to transfer my course from physical lectures type to online lectures so that I can continue my classes.
 
I hope to get your approval on this matter soon. I am looking forward to receiving your response.

Yours faithfully,
Shadia Rahman.
