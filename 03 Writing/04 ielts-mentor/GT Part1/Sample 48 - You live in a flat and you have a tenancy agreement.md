# You live in a flat and you have a tenancy agreement which states that you must give three months' notice when you wish to leave. You have paid a deposit of two months' rent. Now a member of your family has a problem and you need to give up your flat and return home as soon as possible.

Write a letter to your landlady. Explain your circumstances, tell her what you intend to do and ask her for special consideration.

You should write at least 150 words.

You do not need to write your own address.

Begin your letter as follows:
Dear...

Dear margarita,
I am writing in deep sorrow to inform you that my only son Andrew is severely ill and hence we are leaving for our home town once and for all. I would request you to settle our tenancy agreement before I exit. 

As you know we rented your house three years back , all was going well for us from then, until last month when my son Andrew was diagnosed of a benign growth - a suspected brain tumor. As you can assume, our life has turned miserable from that moment. We plan to move back to our hometown seeking more expertise in his treatment.

Given the situation , I would request you to kindly settle our contract on house renting. Just letting you know, I paid $10000 as advance prior to occupancy and also would plead you to wave me the three months notice period, as such a day was unexpected. Please let me know when you could return the advance amount so as to facilitate my exit.

hope you will consider the circumstances , under which I am requesting such a favor from you and will do the needed full as an act of appeasing.

Thanking you
sincerely
Jones.
