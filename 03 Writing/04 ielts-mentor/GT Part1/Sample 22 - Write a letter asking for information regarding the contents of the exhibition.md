Dear Sir / Madam,
 
I am organising a group of students to pay a visit to the historical exhibition in your town. This visit will be part of our schoolâ€™s activities to encourage the students to take part in social surveys. Therefore, I would be grateful if you could supply me with the following information.

First of all, what are the dates between which the exhibition will be held, and what the daily opening hours? Secondly, what is the size of the exhibition, what is its theme and what objects are on display? Thirdly, are there any other activities being held in connection with the exhibition?

I must point out that I hope to bring over students to the exhibition. So I would like to inquire if there is any discount available on entrance tickets for students. If so, how much is the discount and what is the minimum number of students necessary to qualify for it?

I look forward to your reply.

Yours sincerely,
Sarah Johnson

 

## Model Answer 2:

Dear Sir/Madam,

I am Prashant Dixit, a 23-year-old student from R.V. College of arts, Bangalore. As a part of student social survey project, we were planning to visit the historical exhibition in your town. I am writing to you to seek further details on the exhibition.

Though, I understand, this is a historical exhibition, but could you please elucidate on its content, such as, is there any particular period in history that this exhibition focuses on? What is the highlight of the exhibition and how students can benefit from visiting it? Could you also apprise me of the exhibition dates and timings?

As I mentioned, I am planning this tour for a group of student, would it be possible for us to get any discount on group booking or perhaps for students?

I would be highly obliged if you could provide these details at your earliest convenience so that I can start making the transport and accommodation arrangements.

Sincerely Yours,

Prashant.
