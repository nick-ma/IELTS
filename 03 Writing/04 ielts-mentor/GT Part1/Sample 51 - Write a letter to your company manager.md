## Answer 1:

Dear Mr James,

I am writing to express my thanks for the five years that I spent working with you in St Jones company and I'd like to inform you that I am resigning by the end of next month.

Working as a sale supervisor for the last five years, I have gained very good experience in dealing with customers and marketing skills that promote me a managerial position in Dunken's Brothers Company. I asked them to allow me joining my new position at the beginning of November to give me the appropriate time to be in charge with you till you find another employee.

I will always remember the perfect time that I spent working with your team. All the people of the group were helpful, co-operative and friendly. I wish great progress and success for you and your team.

Yours Sincerely,

Rien.
