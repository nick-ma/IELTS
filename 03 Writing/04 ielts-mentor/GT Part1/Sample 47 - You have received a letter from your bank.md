# You have received a letter from your bank, asking you to acknowledge receipt of a new bank card. However, the card was missing from the envelope.

Write a letter to the bank's head office. In your letter:

- explain why you are writing
- express concern about the missing card
- ask them what they intend to do

You should write at least 150 words.
Allow yourself 20 minutes for this task.

You do NOT need to write your own address.


 
## Model Answer:

Dear Sir,

I am writing to inform you that I received a letter from my bank today, which was supposed to contain my new bank card. Unfortunately, there was no bank card enclosed in the envelope when I opened it.

I telephoned the bank to explain the problem, but I could not get through to the right department, even though I waited on the line for over half an hour, which was extremely annoying.

In the letter, you asked me to acknowledge the receipt of the card, but obviously, I cannot do this as I have not received it. I am now very worried because it is a possibility that my card has gone to another customer or got lost. What will happen if somebody has already used the card and spent my money? Will the bank repay me?

Is it possible for the bank to cancel this card so nobody else can use it? Could you also send me a new card by secure means?

I hope to hear from you soon.

Sincerely,
