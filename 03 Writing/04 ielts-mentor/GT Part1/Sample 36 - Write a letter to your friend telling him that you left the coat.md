# You have just spent a weekend at a friend’s house. When you returned home, you discovered you have left a coat containing some belongings in his house.

Write a letter to your friend telling him that you left the coat. Tell him what the coat looks like, where you think you left it and what was inside it. Make some suggestions about how to get it back.

You should write at least 150 words.

You do NOT need to write your own address. Begin your letter as follows:

Dear Steven,

Dear Steven,

I am back at home now after that great weekend at your house. Thanks very much for putting me up. I hope you‛ll be able to come and stay with me sometime soon as well.

Unfortunately, I left my new coat at your house. Do you remember the dark brown one that I wore when we went walking on Saturday afternoon? It is a New Look coat that goes down to mid-thigh level. It has a black collar, dark brown buttons and large pockets on both sides. I think I left it on the hooks behind your front door. Do you remember we hung up our coats there when we got back from our walk?

It‛s quite important for me as I have my wallet in the inside breast pocket and my diary in the right outside pocket. I have a friend who is driving through your town on Thursday and he will be quite near your office. Could he please collect it from there? I have given him your office phone number and he will call you on Thursday morning. Give me a call if this is not possible.

Anyway, thanks again for a great weekend and I hope to see you soon.

Regards,

Breene Flower.
