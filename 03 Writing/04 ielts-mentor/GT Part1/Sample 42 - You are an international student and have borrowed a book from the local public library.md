## Model Answer:

Last week I borrowed an English grammar book, "English Grammar Exercises" from your library to help me improve my knowledge of English. It was extremely useful, so when I went to visit a friend I took the book with me to show her how good it was.

Unfortunately, when I was on the bus going home, I fell asleep and missed my bus stop. I woke up at the next stop and rushed forward to the driver to ask him to stop but forgot to bring the book. As a result, the book was left on the bus. When I rang the bus company the next day, they could not find it and suggested that somebody must have picked it up.

Could you please let me know what I have to do now? As I am an international student I do not have very much money, but of course, I will pay for a new copy of the book if this is necessary.

Yours faithfully
