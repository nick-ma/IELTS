## Model Answer 1:

Dear Sir / Madam,

I am a recent customer of your rental company having I rented a car from your downtown outlet in Detroit. The car hired was an economy model vehicle which I rented from March 21st to the present. I would like to commend your company on their professionalism and the service offered, and as such I am sure you will handle my incident with these qualities.

Unfortunately, I had an unavoidable accident involving the aforementioned vehicle and another party. The accident was caused by the other car failing to stop at the red light of the intersection I was passing through, and as such the second party collided into the driver's side of my automobile. The police were informed in situ, whereupon they recorded information regarding the accident and the other driver’s insurance details.

The police established the other driver's responsibility for the accident, and the second party's insurance company has been informed. I would like to request that a replacement vehicle should be offered while my current vehicle is incapacitated. Once again, I would like to commend your company's professional attitude.

Yours sincerely

David Clark

## Model Answer 2:

Dear Sir / Madam,

I recently rented an Alto car from your company and let me tell you, you have some world class employees working with you. The quality of the vehicle was top-notch and you provide impeccable services as per my experience. I hired this car a week back from your branch office which is situated in sector 22 Chandigarh. However, It is a great regret that an accident spoiled both my holiday and spirit and caused some damages to the car.

I was driving to Kalka station from Chandigarh to pick up one of my friends from the railway station when a small accident took place. It was not my fault. I was standing at the red light when suddenly another car coming at a very high speed hit my vehicle from behind, leaving the bumper and the silence of the car somewhat broken.

A police officer on duty has lodged a FIR against the other driver, and after checking all the essential documents, the police officer has advised the other driver to bear all the charges for the repairing and servicing. I made the booking of this vehicle till 14th March, still, 2 days left, hence my sincere request to you is to please arrange for the another car for me and have this one collected from my Hotel, which is in sector 17 Chandigarh. The name of the Hotel is The Royal Plaza, I am staying in room no. 203. I shall be very thankful to you.

Yours Truly,
PG
