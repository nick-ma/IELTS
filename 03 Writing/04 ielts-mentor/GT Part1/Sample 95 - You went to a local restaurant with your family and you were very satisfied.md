Dear Sir/Madam,

My name is Vishwa Vinutna. I am a regular reader of your daily newspaper “Times of India.” I am writing this letter to inform you about an authentic restaurant called “Step and Eat” which I had visited recently with my family and thought it to be a worth visiting place for others.

It is a multi-cuisine restaurant, located on Smith Street near National park in our town. I went there with my family members last Sunday. As we are fond of Italian food my husband ordered an Italian meal. The meal comprised of a delicious soup, a signature dish of the hotel known as mixed vegetable spaghetti and at the end, we had a mouth savouring dessert called marshmallows which were with a perfect creamy texture. It was one of the memorable dinners I ever had with my family.

The restaurant is worth visiting for everyone in the town because it offers a wide range of varieties in food to satisfy the human palate. Moreover, it maintains proper cleanliness and hygiene. The staff members here are so polite, co-operative as well as of welcome natured which gives a diligent feeling to the customers.

Hence I request you to write an article about the goodness of restaurant so that more people could come to know and visit it. I look forward to hearing from you.

Yours faithfully,
Vishwa Vinutna.
