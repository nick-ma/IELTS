## Sample Answer 1:

Dear Sir,

My name is Namrata. I have applied to get admission in Master of Science stream in your university. I am writing this letter to let you know that I would not be able to attend today's interview because of urgent meeting in my office. I work with Optus in software development telecom domain.  My meeting will start at 12 PM and end till 2 PM, whereas interview timing is 1 PM.

This interview is very important for me, as I am willing to take admission this year only to pursue my MS. I have worked hard to get an interview call from such a renowned university.

Therefore, I request you to kindly reschedule my interview to some other day or post 2 PM same day. For this I shall always be thankful to you. Also let me know if any test I need to attend as the part of interview process and how long the interview will continue.

Looking forward to hearing from you.

Sincerely yours,
Namrata

## Sample Answer 2:
Dear Sir,

Hope you are doing great. I have received your invitation about the interview. I wish I could attend the interview. But, unfortunately I cannot come at the specified time because of another commitment at the same time.

A seminar is being held on the same day and my company has designated me to attend the seminar. It will start in the morning at 8am and will continue until 4pm in the afternoon. Please accept my apology for not attending the interview. However, I can come in the evening on the same day as I will be free at 4pm or some other day whichever is convenient to you. Meanwhile, I would appreciate you could tell the duration of the interview. Also, will it be an oral interview only or I have to prepare for test as well?

Once again my sincere apology for not attending the interview at the scheduled time.

I look forward to hearing from you soon.

Yours faithfully.
Mansoor
