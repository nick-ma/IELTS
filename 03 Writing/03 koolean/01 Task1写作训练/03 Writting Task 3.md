## Answer:

Dear Mike,

I hope you won't be surprised when you receive my letter. I am Nick, your new neighbour, and my family just moved to this quiet and beautiful neighbourhood last week.

As you may guess, I am very excited that I finally managed to live in my dream house, therefore, I plan to hold a party to celebrate this iconic occasion. As I manage to invite some of my best friends and a couple of colleagues, there are about 10 to 12 persons join this party. 

According to the plan, the party consists of 3 parts. The first part is showing my house to people, and the second part is having an open-air BBQ in the garden, this should be the highlight of this party. And finally, we back into the living room and hold a karaoke activity, which can be the most I concern that the noise would disturb you. As we will control the music volume at a low level, and hope it won't bring trouble.

Please allow me on behalf of my family We welcome you and your family to join this party too. The party will be started at 2 PM tomorrow, and I wish I can see your family at there.

Yours, Nick.
