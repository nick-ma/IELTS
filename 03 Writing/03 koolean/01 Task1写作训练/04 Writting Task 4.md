## Answer:

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to you to complain a dishwasher that I bought from your store last month. The dishwasher just works for serval days since it has been installed in my kitchen, and now it stops to response any operations. 

I have called your sales and talked about this problem for a couple of times, but every time they just let me unplug the power and wait for a professional person come to check it out. However, three weeks have passed and still, no one came to solve the problem. As a consequence, during these days, I have to wash all the dirty stuff such as cups, bowls, dishes, forks, knives by hand as I have replaced the old dishwasher with this out of function one. I can't stand for it anymore.

So, I hope the dishwasher can be repaired by this weekend, and please send someone who can do this job, otherwise I will return this dishwasher and ask for a full refund.

I am looking forward to your reply.

Yours, Nick.
