## Answer

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to you to claim a lost of my belongings.

I recently went to Australia for holiday from 22 June to 29 June, and I had bought a travel insurance from your company which can cover any lost of my valuable belongings, including laptop computers, mobile phones, tablet computers, etc. 

One of my most expensive items is a laptop which brand is Apple and its model is Mac Book Pro, and I spent $3699 to buy it in an Apple Store last month, it was almost brand new when is lost.

Unfortunately, on 25 June morning when I went to Sydney Airport by minibus in a hurry, I found my laptop wasn't in my backpack. I was not sure where and when it lost. I felt so unhappy, although I called the service hotline of minibus company about this lost, I didn't get any valuable information.

Since I had listed the lost laptop on the insurance contract in advanced, and this situation should match the claim rule, I ask for a fully claim amount of my lost computer, which should be $3699.

I am looking forward to your reply.

Sincerely, Nick.
