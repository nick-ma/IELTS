Dear Sir or Madam,

I hope you will not be surprised when you receive this letter. As you may know, I have organized a busines meeting that will be held in next week which will be changed.

I am sorry for these changes and the inconvenience that brings to you. As the orinagal arrangement, this meeting will be held in the bigest mutil-functional meeting center in Hillton Hotel, but I just received the hotel manager's phone that said the meeting center we booked was damaged by storm last  night. Water came into roof and the projectors are all out of function, and they cannot be fixed before our meeting start date.

The hotel manager have rearranged a new place, the Town Meeting Center, for our meeting, but it's about 10 minutes drive away from Hilton Hotel. The Hilton Hotel will provide our attendees a shuttle bus between hotel and Town Meeting Center for free, if you present your attendee card to caretaker in advance.

Again, I am so sorry about these inconvenience changes, and hope you could attend this meeting.

Sincerely, Nick.

I am sorry for these changes and the inconvenience that it brings to you. As the original arrangement, this meeting will be held in the biggest multi-functional meeting room of Hilton Hotel, but I just received the call from the manager of the hotel that said the meeting room we booked was damaged by the storm last night. Water came into the roof and all projectors are out of function, furthermore, they cannot be repaired by the date of the meeting.
