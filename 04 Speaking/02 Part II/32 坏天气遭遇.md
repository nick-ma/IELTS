Well, one particularly unpleasant experience that sticks in my memory was the time I went to Huangshan with my mum and brother, which must have been about 2 or 3 years ago, when my mum came over to visit me in Hangzhou. We had decided to go travelling to Huangshan as none of us had been there before, and we'd heard a lot of great things about it.

And basically what happened was that we got caught in a big storm, which seemed to spring up out of nowhere, because one minute it was pretty sunny, and the next it was, quite literally, pouring down with rain, and I mean, REALLY chucking it down!

What didn't help us was the fact that, at the time the storm hit, we were right on top of a mountain, and because we hadn't checked the weather forecast, we didn't have any umbrellas with us, so we got absolutely soaked!
And the worst thing was, when we reached the cable car to get down the mountain, we were told that it had closed early for safety reasons, coz there were some flashes of lightening, and this apparently made the cable car unsafe to go in.

So we ended up having no choice but to walk down the mountain instead, and because it was still raining when we got to the bottom, we couldn't find a single free taxi. So there we were, completely drenched and utterly exhausted, stuck in the middle of nowhere.

Thankfully, though, after what seemed like an eternity, a minivan finally pulled up and gave us a lift back to where we were staying, which was a huge relief. I honestly don't know what we would have done if it hadn't come, because it was getting pretty dark and most people had already left the mountains, so thank goodness it came!

And looking back on it now, I would say I actually gained quite a lot from this experience, as it's really kind of taught me to appreciate the times when I do have easy access to transportation, which is most of the time.

So yeah, that's pretty much it, and I hope the story wasn't too boring!
