In general, Japanese cuisine is known for its delicious and styles.
Sushi is the Japanese preparation and serving of cooked vinegared rice combined with varied ingredients, chiefly seafood, vegetables, meat, and occasionally tropical fruits.
Sushi is always camera ready and looks inviting cos its ingredients are just so fresh.
