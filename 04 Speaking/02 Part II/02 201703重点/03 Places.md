## A café you have been to （新题）
I went to a café about two weeks ago to attend a birthday celebration of one of my colleagues and this was a unique place that caught my eyes. The name of this café is 'Café Kitty' and it’s near the People Square. I was a bit inquisitive about the birthday celebration in a café. But after I reached there, I found out it was quite a large place and in fact had much more facilities than a conventional party centre.  I once heard about this café but never went there as it is located far away from my home and office.

It was Wednesday evening when one of my colleagues reminded me the birthday invitation of Jimy, our boss. I went to the café with 3 colleagues and before reaching there we bought a gift for Jimy.

There were about 30 people in total and most of them were my colleagues. I wished Jimy a happy birthday and gave the present we bought. I sat in a corner and enjoyed the soft music that was playing. A piece of birthday cake was served and it was the first thing I ate there. After that, I drank a glass of water. I was then asked whether I would like to join the supper of wait a while. I had to get back home early that day and that’s why instead of a dinner, I preferred to eat my supper. But to my amazement, more than 20 items were served which were white heavy for the evening meal. However, I ate the soup first and then went for the traditional Italian item called primo. Then I ate antipasto before I ate the dessert. There were probably more items in the supper but I was full and did not eat anything further.

I would say I had a very delightful experience in this café. The environment was quite unique with gorgeous painting and decoration. The spacious café offered an excellent experience that made me like this place very much. The food items were delicious and the service boys were very friendly and amiable.

历史建筑的环境
I am going to describe an iconic historical architecture, which is the Humbel Administrator's Gardoen.
I have been there twice in recent 5 years, and every time I was there, I had different feelings of the garden.

The Humble Administrator’s Garden was built in the early years of Zhengde in the Ming Dynasty, with a history of over 500 years. It is one of the representative works of classical gardens at south of the Yangtze River. It is known as “Four Famous Gardens” in China together with the Beijing Summer Palace, Chengde Mountain Resort and Suzhou Lingering Garden.

The Humble Administrator’s Garden is located in the northeastern corner of the ancient city Suzhou. It is the largest classical garden in Suzhou, covering an area of 52,000 square metres. The whole garden is water-centered, with green hills, delicate pavilions and lush flowers and trees, full of poetic and pictorial splendor and rich features of the south of the lower reaches of the Yangtze River. 
When I was wandering around the garden and walking through the corridors, I could feel the quite and ancient poetic, which made me calm and peacful, and I pretty enjoyed it.
The garden is divided into three parts, eastern, central and west, and each has its own unique character. The East Garden is spaciousness; the Central Garden is the essence of the whole park; and the West Garden has exquisite buildings. The southern part of the garden is the residential area, which reflecting the typical residential pattern of the south of the Yangtze River. 
By visiting the garden, I felt the wisdom of the Chinese ancient architectural techniques and the wisdom of their ancestors.

That's all about the descrption of a historical architecture, and thanks very much for listening.
