## An event in history in your country （新题）
秦始皇统一六国
## A plan in your life(not about your work or study)  （新题）
计划去cairns度假

Everybody has a plan for future. Though future is uncertain and many times unpredictable, I believe that to some extent our future depends on our actions on past and present. In the future, I want to run a mega shopping mall business where my involvement would not be mandatory to run the daily business and I would enjoy my time by visiting different places of the world.

After I finished my graduation, I started working for a small company. Now I am working for a large multinational company I have planned to work till I become 36 and then I will take early retirement. The money I will inherit and the amount I am currently saving per month should allow me to start a business. I have planned to start a big shopping mall. I will have my close relatives as the employees and authorities of the business and initially I will work in this shopping mall for 2-3 years to make it run smoothly. When the business would go on with its own path, I will enjoy my vacation and would visit different renowned and beautiful cities of the world. I will visit Asia, Europe, Russia and many more places.

Hopefully, I will enjoy the retirement and the trips. Though I am not sure about the future but I have already planned for it. Because I believe proper planning and initiation is the half of the total task and fulfilling dream. I have already taken some steps towards achieving my future plan.

## A time something made you laugh （新题）
To Let ／ Toilet

OK, well something that really made me laugh recently was a story that one of my firends told to me last month. Last month, my friend who shared the story with me went to England with his colloague for bussniss trip. When they took airport shuttle bus to their hotel, my friend was attracted by the scenery along the way. Suddenly he heard his colleague murmured in a low voice, why did London have so many toilets? Did the Londoners like to use public toilets? And every toilet signs below there are numbers, it must be the phone number for booking. My firend was shocked on what he was heard and then started laughing from ear to ear. Dude, said by my friend, please look a little more carefully, it was TO LET, not TOILET. TO LET means a house for rent, between O and L, there was a space, not a letter I. And my friend couldn't stop laughing until they arrived the hotel. 

When he came back to China, he told this funny story to me, and not surprisingly, I was having a blast. I thought I was laughing so much that my sides were beginning to hurt.
Until now, whenever I see the public toilet signs in the street, that funny story will appear in my mind. And I tell to myself that I won't commit that silly mistake if I came to London some day.

That's all about the funny things that made my laugh, and thanks very much for listening.

## A decision someone made that you disagreed with（新题）
We all have to make decisions from time to time.

 Some decisions are agreed upon by all, whereas some decisions are not liked by all.

 Here, I would like to talk about a decision, which was made by my two friends Raman

and Sunder, when we were in 10th class.

 They decided to bunk school and go to watch a movie in a multiplex.

 I disagreed strongly.

 First of all, the idea of bunking school did not seem right to me.

 Then, going for a movie without parents’ permission was out of question as far as my

thinking was concerned.

 I advised them to go for the movie on a Sunday, in the morning show, after taking

permission from our parents.

 But they were adamant, and were forcing me also to accompany them.

 I was in a dilemma, as I did not want to disappoint my friends.

 But, my father is very strict.

 I knew that if he found out, he would be very upset and may even not talk to me for

days.

 I could not even bear to think of that.

 So, I said a firm no to my friends and again tried to dissuade them from bunking

school.

 They, however, did not agree and went for the movie.

 I remember, I felt very light at heart for not going with them.

 I cannot even think of lying to my parents, or hiding anything from them.

 So, this was the decision made by my friends which I did not like.
