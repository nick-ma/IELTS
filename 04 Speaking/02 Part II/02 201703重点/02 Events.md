计划去cairns度假

Everybody has a plan for future. Though future is uncertain and many times unpredictable, I believe that to some extent our future depends on our actions on past and present. In the future, I want to run a mega shopping mall business where my involvement would not be mandatory to run the daily business and I would enjoy my time by visiting different places of the world.

After I finished my graduation, I started working for a small company. Now I am working for a large multinational company I have planned to work till I become 36 and then I will take early retirement. The money I will inherit and the amount I am currently saving per month should allow me to start a business. I have planned to start a big shopping mall. I will have my close relatives as the employees and authorities of the business and initially I will work in this shopping mall for 2-3 years to make it run smoothly. When the business would go on with its own path, I will enjoy my vacation and would visit different renowned and beautiful cities of the world. I will visit Asia, Europe, Russia and many more places.

Hopefully, I will enjoy the retirement and the trips. Though I am not sure about the future but I have already planned for it. Because I believe proper planning and initiation is the half of the total task and fulfilling dream. I have already taken some steps towards achieving my future plan.

## A time something made you laugh （新题）
To Let ／ Toilet

OK, well something that really made me laugh recently was a story that one of my firends told to me last month. Last month, my friend who shared the story with me went to England with his colloague for bussniss trip. When they took airport shuttle bus to their hotel, my friend was attracted by the scenery along the way. Suddenly he heard his colleague murmured in a low voice, why did London have so many toilets? Did the Londoners like to use public toilets? And every toilet signs below there are numbers, it must be the phone number for booking. My firend was shocked on what he was heard and then started laughing from ear to ear. Dude, said by my friend, please look a little more carefully, it was TO LET, not TOILET. TO LET means a house for rent, between O and L, there was a space, not a letter I. And my friend couldn't stop laughing until they arrived the hotel. 

When he came back to China, he told this funny story to me, and not surprisingly, I was having a blast. I thought I was laughing so much that my sides were beginning to hurt.
Until now, whenever I see the public toilet signs in the street, that funny story will appear in my mind. And I tell to myself that I won't commit that silly mistake if I came to London some day.

That's all about the funny things that made my laugh, and thanks very much for listening.

and Sunder, when we were in 10th class.

 First of all, the idea of bunking school did not seem right to me.

 Then, going for a movie without parents’ permission was out of question as far as my

thinking was concerned.

 I advised them to go for the movie on a Sunday, in the morning show, after taking

permission from our parents.

 But they were adamant, and were forcing me also to accompany them.

 I was in a dilemma, as I did not want to disappoint my friends.

 But, my father is very strict.

days.

school.

 They, however, did not agree and went for the movie.

 I remember, I felt very light at heart for not going with them.

 I cannot even think of lying to my parents, or hiding anything from them.

 So, this was the decision made by my friends which I did not like.

## An interesting talk or speech（新题）
大堡礁对生物的讲解
[广告适用]
Last year, I saw a TV advertisement on a Travel channel. It was a tourist advertisiment about the Great Barrier Reef in Australia. In the ad, the blue sea water decorated with colorful coral reefs, there are a variety of beautiful fishes, jellyfishes, marine turtles, and even sharks, they were wimming through coral reefs, like a fairyland in the world.

The ad was so attritive and I decided to go there in no time. However, the trip wasn't cheap, I browsed the internet and made phone call to turise agencies, and found a typical trip to Cairns, where the Great Barrier Reef were, cost 20,000 RMB per person, and a little discount on children. That meant I had to plan at least a 60,000 rmb budget for the trip for my family.  

[计划适用]
To make this fantastic dream trip into reality, I drew a plan on saving money and travel itinerary. First, from this month, I save 5,000 rmb every month in a travel fund account, so 1 year leater, I will have 60,000 rmb funds. Second, I start to brows airlines website to hunt the cheapest tickets. At the mainwhile, I did researchs of the accommodations and touries attractions in Cairns. 
I believe that after the above plan, this trip will never let me and my family down.

[运动场景适用]

On January this year, my wife my daughter and I came to Cairns. When we arrived at Cairns Airport and steped out of plane, I felt heat waves were blowing my face, yes, Cairns was in summer, and ground temperature was 35 C. It was pretty hot. When we had settled in accommodation, and rest for a night, we got up early at next morning and rush to the harbour to take the ship to diving site. 
It took about 1 hour and we arrived the destination, I was soon amazied by the nature beauty. We chose a very good dive site, where there were beautiful coral reefs and a lot of marine life, for example, coral reef fish, all kinds of jellyfish, and even sharks.

I was going to do snorkeling, because the cost of snorkeling has been included in the ticket. But the scenery there was really beautiful, and deep dive costs were relatively reasonable, I decided to try a diving which I never had done before.

Of course, my wife and daughter still do snorkeling. After paying the cost, the coach gathered us, and began to explain the reminds and cautions, and what marine lifes we would see in the water while diving as well. 

[演讲]
The Great Barrier Reef is rated as one of the world's largest coral reefs and is one of seven natural wonders of our planet. It is with an area of ​​about 350,000 square kilometers, including 1625 types of fish, 600 or more corals, 215 species of birds, and 133 sharks. 
The Great Barrier Reef is beautiful and diverse, but it also under threat. The main threat comes from the extreme weather caused by climate warming, the pollution of water, the development of the coastline and fisheries activities. And river pollution damage to coral reefs even greater than the threat of starfish.
I listened to these, in the heartfelt exclamation of the magical beauty of nature, but also on the human activities of the destruction of the natural miracle of the results of deep concern.

[不让带手机-下水]
Next, we put on the diving suit, back oxygen cylinder, ready to start the water. I was told that diving was not able to carry the phone. The reason is because the depth of the diving is relatively deep, water pressure is great, even if the use of mobile phone waterproof bag is still possible to lead to damage to the phone. On the other hand, the current mobile phone is a touch screen, underwater touch screen is a failure. Even if the phone can not carry on any operation.

This is my first dive, after a short period of time to adapt and adjust, I began to enjoy the beauty of the sea below. I was stunned by the sight of my eyes, the flocks of fish between the colorful coral reefs, jellyfish gently wandering around me, in the distance there is a look like a shark fish, because in the water can not speak , I have no way to verify the coach, then we returned to the ship, the coach told me that it is indeed a shark, but a coral reef unique to a shark, has been endangered species, rarely see, I can today It was particularly lucky to see.

去年，我看到了一则广告，关于澳大利亚大堡礁的旅游广告。在广告中，碧蓝的海水妆点着五颜六色的珊瑚礁，还有各种漂亮的鱼、水母、海龟、甚至还有鲨鱼，在珊瑚礁间穿梭游动，犹如人间仙境一般。
然后，我决定一定要去一次大堡礁度假。但是去一次并不便宜，每个人的费用大约是2万RMB，而且小孩子也没什么折扣。这其中最大的费用是机票和住宿费。这就意味着，我需要从现在开始攒钱，要攒够6万元才能实现这个计划。
我的详细计划是这样的，每个月从我的收入中拿出5000元作为旅游基金存放在一个独立的账户中，从第二个月开始用基金的余额购买3个月期的保本理财产品，这样可以避免在为期一年的准备过程中，由于通货膨胀的因素而导致现金的贬值。当然，这只是财务方面的准备。
在住宿和美食方面，我也需要事先做好准备，例如，寻找便宜又方便出行的住宿地点，尽可能多的品尝当地的美食，同时也要尽可能多的游玩当地的美景等。
我相信，经过以上周密的计划，这次旅行一定不会让我和我的家人失望的。

今年的1月份，我和我的家人来到了澳大利亚的凯恩斯。
我去凯恩斯度假，在度假的期间我参加了一次去大堡礁潜水的活动。我们乘了大约一个小时的快艇来到了潜水地点，我当时就被那里的自然美景惊呆了。
我们选择了一个非常好的潜水地点，那里有美丽的珊瑚礁和非常多的海洋生物，例如，珊瑚礁鱼类，各种的水母，甚至还有鲨鱼。
我本来是打算去做浮潜的，因为浮潜的费用已经包含在船票里了。但是那里的景色实在是太美了，而且深潜的费用也相对合理，我决定尝试一下从来没有做过的深潜。
当然，我的妻子和女儿还是做浮潜。 付过费用之后，教练把我们集中在一，开始讲解深潜的动作要领和注意事项，同时也介绍了我们将要在潜水的过程中看到的海洋生物。大堡礁被评为世界上最大的珊瑚礁群，是7大自然奇迹之一，面积大约35万平方公里，包含1625中鱼类，600种以上的珊瑚虫，215种鸟类，133种鲨鱼等。大堡礁虽然很大，但是也很脆弱。主要的威胁来自于气候变暖带来的极端天气，污染的水源，海岸线的开发以及渔业活动。而河流污染对珊瑚礁的损坏竟然比海星的威胁还要大。
我听了这些之后，在由衷感叹大自然神奇美丽的同时也对人类活动对大自然奇迹的破坏结果感到深深的忧虑。

接下来，我们穿上潜水服，背上氧气瓶，准备开始下水了。我被告知，潜水是不能携带手机的。原因一方面是由于潜水的深度比较深，水压很大，即便是使用了手机防水袋依然可能会进水导致手机损坏。另一方面是，现在的手机都是触摸屏，在水下触摸屏是失灵的。即便把手机带下去不能进行任何的操作。

这是我第一次潜水，在经过一小段时间的适应和调整之后，我开始从容的欣赏海面以下的美景。我被眼前的美景惊呆了，成群的鱼儿穿梭在五颜六色的珊瑚礁之间，水母在我身边轻轻的游荡，在远处还有一条看上去很像鲨鱼的鱼，因为在水底无法说话，我也就没办法向教练求证，后来我们回到船上之后，教练跟我说那个确实是鲨鱼，不过是珊瑚礁特有的一种鲨鱼，已经属于濒危物种，很少能看到的，我今天能看到真是特别幸运。



I have heard lots of speeches, lectures throughout different stages of my life and among them the speech was given by a tour guide when I spent my holiday in the Great Barrier Reef, Cairns, is the most interesting one and I still vividly recall it.

It was last winter, while at Cairns it was summer. 

### Possible Answer 1: 
I have heard numerous speeches, lectures, commentaries on various topics and issues throughout different stages of my life and among them the speech that was given by our primary school teacher on our farewell day is the most influential one and I still vividly recall it. The teacher who gave the speech was Mr. Mark Augustine and he was in his late forties at that time. As fifth-grade school going kids, we did not comprehend quite clearly what was the school farewell all about. We knew that this is going to be our last day at our primary school and we would start our new school soon. Mr. Mark was already a revered teacher for his teaching style, good manner, humour and honesty. Rumour had that, he was much more qualified to be a college professor rather than being a primary school teacher.

On the day, we had our parents present in school and we had been enjoying everything. As part of the farewell speech, Mr. Mark approached to the stage and started mentioning what funny things we had done in the last 5 years. We as well as our parents started laughing on the things he mentioned. He mentioned how a kid started screaming at the sight of a cockroach, how a kid of class two expressed his friendship to a girl, how we tried to play amid of the class and many more interesting and funny events.

He then moved on topics that I still hear in my mind. He told how studying is our primary responsibility, how we should listen to our parents, how have we achieved our liberation as a nation, how to respect the Mother Nature and all the honesty and bravery we should possess in our heart. The topics and his way of presenting them vibrated us heavily. I can still remember how the advice came back to my life time to time. As a kid, those advice and moralities were probably way to heavy to grasp but I still believe that the speech had a great impact in my life as well as the lives of the other kids who were present there.  

### Sample Answer 2: 
Speeches are funny things!  Some people are really good at public speaking, and others just aren’t.  I think it is very difficult to talk in front of other people in an engaging way but when people do this really well, then you remember the occasion and how you felt at the time too.  Obviously, really bad speeches can be memorable too, but I’m not going to talk about any of those today.

I want to tell you about a short speech I heard in a work context, I’ll tell you who gave the speech, what it was about and why I think it was so good.

The speech was given by a manager in a place I was working.  He was giving a speech to say goodbye to one of our colleagues who was leaving to set up as an independent consultant, but who had worked at the organisation a very long time, perhaps forty years.  Everyone was sad to see this person go, as they were very popular, but we all wished them well and understood why they felt they needed to move on.  It was a reasonably big workforce, so about sixty of us had gathered in the open-plan office to say goodbye and present a gift to our departing friend and co-worker.

I think sometimes ‘leaving-do’s’ can be really awkward and embarrassing  Everyone stands around self-consciously and there is an excruciating and brief ‘goodbye and thank you’ from the boss, and then everyone stares at the poor person who is leaving whilst they rip open and read a rapidly bought card and mumble their  thanks for a rather anonymous gift. This, however, was different.  Our manager had made a real effort to prepare a good speech that was funny, well-researched, engaging and genuinely affectionate.  For example, one of the things he did, was going back to our colleagues original application form and he put together a quiz for all of us to do, in which we had to guess what hobbies and qualifications they had declared all that time ago.  It was a great way to ‘break the ice’ and involve everyone, and the results were hilarious.  Even the colleague who was leaving was amazed at the contents of his original form.  He also thanked the colleague for some very specific work that he had done, and read out comments from others that he had been collecting over the last couple of weeks which were mini testimonials and statements of appreciation from other colleagues.

I think the speech was good because it involved everyone, shared funny (but not too private) stories that were relevant to the leaver, and the effort our boss had put into preparing it showed his respect and admiration for the colleague who was departing.  The quiz also gave everyone something to talk about, so people could chat and mingle a bit after the presentation. It was also not too long!  It held interest, and was appropriate for the context.

For me, the speech was a really good example of how to communicate effectively on such an occasion.  It was perfectly judged and helped bring the team together even though someone was leaving, and made me – and others too – feel happy and lucky that we worked in such a caring team.
