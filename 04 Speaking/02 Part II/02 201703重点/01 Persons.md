## Two people from the same family
Please say 
- What do they look like? 
- How similar are these two persons? 
- How much time do they spend together? 
- Why did you choose to talk about these two persons?

I know many people and many families.
But, here I would like to talk about two people of the same family.
They lived in my neighbourhood in my parental house.
I have known them since my childhood.
They are my friends too.
Their names are Jyoti and Simran.
They are sisters, in fact they are twins.
They spend all their time together.
In fact they seem inseparable.
I chose to talk about them because they are my good friends.
They are 22 years old.
They both have long hair, fair complexion and sparkling black eyes.
Jyoti has a mole on her chin and this is the only point of difference in them.
They look as similar as two peas in a pod.

But when you come to know them better, you find that they are poles apart in nature. Jyoti is a very polite and down-to-earth person whereas Simran is very blunt and rude at times.
Jyoti is an extrovert and likes socialising.
She is also very helpful.
Whenever I am in any need I go to her.
She never lets me down.
In fact she helps anyone who goes to her for any help.
Simran, on the other hand, is an introvert.
She is very quiet and remains in her own shell.
She gives the impression of being selfish.
But as I know her well, I know that she is just the quiet types.
She likes her own company and can sit alone for hours.
I sometimes wonder how two identical twins could be so different in nature.
I like both of them, but I have a better rapport with Jyoti.
We were in the same class.
We used to go to school together.
Both were good at studies.
They did their masters in computer applications.
Now both are working in a multinational company.
