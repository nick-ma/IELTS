## Model Answer
Ok, well I have to admit that my first reaction upon seeing this topic was that of horror, followed by panic, because it’s been absolutely ages since I made anything, and I wasn’t sure if I would be able to remember something, so I had to rack my brains quite a bit just now, and thankfully something came to mind, which was a brass candlestick I made when I was about 10 or 11, so that’s what I'm gonna talk about.
And as for what made me decide to make a candlestick, well, it was basically a task that we were given in one of our middle school classes, so we didn’t really have a choice in the matter, and I remember thinking at the time that I had no idea how on earth we were going to be able to make one, especially when the teacher just handed us two blocks of metal and told us to get started. But thankfully, though, he then showed us a machine, which I think was called a lathe, or something like that, and gave us a demonstration of how we could use it to shape a piece of metal into something nice, so it was really quite a cool machine!
Anyway, we then all had to draw a rough design of how we wanted our candlesticks to look, and after doing that, we were then ready to try and create those designs using the machine, and believe it or not, I somehow managed to succeed!
And regarding how I felt after I’d finished it, well, as you can imagine, it was pretty satisfying, but what made me feel even better was giving it to my mum as a present, because I could see from the expression on her face that she really loved it, and that it meant a lot to her, and so for me, it was a really wonderful feeling.
